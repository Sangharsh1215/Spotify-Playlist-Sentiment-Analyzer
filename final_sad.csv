0,Your Power,Happier Than Ever,Billie Eilish,Sad,"Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 1]
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?

Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking

That you'll come back when you can find some peace

Since you left feels like a hollow street

7,One Day,One Day,Tate McRae,Sad,"She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
""Maybe he knows who I am, probably not""
She walks down the hall with her head down low, scared to meet his eyes

A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her, but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice, she runs away

Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind

And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

One day, maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day, she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day, he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day, he'll look into her eyes
And say that, ""You're my only light""

9,I Miss The Way You Were,I Miss The Way You Were,I.U,Sad,"
He turned quite pale when he was first told of it.

""Oh! Dearest!"" he said, ""I should rather not be an earl. None of the boys are earls. Can't I NOT be one?""

But it seemed to be unavoidable. And when, that evening, they sat together by the open window looking out into the shabby street, he and his mother had a long talk about it. Cedric sat on his footstool, clasping one knee in his favorite attitude and wearing a bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of thinking. His grandfather had sent for him to come to England, and his mamma thought he must go.

""Because,"" she said, looking out of the window with sorrowful eyes, ""I know your papa would wish it to be so, Ceddie. He loved his home very much; and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy can't quite understand. I should be a selfish little mother if I did not send you. When you are a man, you will see why.""

Ceddie shook his head mournfully.

""I shall be very sorry to leave Mr. Hobbs,"" he said. ""I'm afraid he'll miss me, and I shall miss him. And I shall miss them all.""

When Mr. Havisham—who was the family lawyer of the Earl of Dorincourt, and who had been sent by him to bring Lord Fauntleroy to England—came the next day, Cedric heard many things. But, somehow, it did not console him to hear that he was to be a very rich man when he grew up, and that he would have castles here and castles there, and great parks and deep mines and grand estates and tenantry. He was troubled about his friend, Mr. Hobbs, and he went to see him at the store soon after breakfast, in great anxiety of mind.

He found him reading the morning paper, and he approached him with a grave demeanor. He really felt it would be a great shock to Mr. Hobbs to hear what had befallen him, and on his way to the store he had been thinking how it would be best to break the news.
""Hello!"" said Mr. Hobbs. ""Mornin'!""

""Good-morning,"" said Cedric.

He did not climb up on the high stool as usual, but sat down on a cracker-box and clasped his knee, and was so silent for a few moments that Mr. Hobbs finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper.

""Hello!"" he said again.

Cedric gathered all his strength of mind together.
""Mr. Hobbs,"" he said, ""do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning?""

""Well,"" replied Mr. Hobbs,—""seems to me it was England.""

""Yes,"" said Cedric; ""but just when Mary came for me, you know?""

Mr. Hobbs rubbed the back of his head.

""We WAS mentioning Queen Victoria and the aristocracy.""

""Yes,"" said Cedric, rather hesitatingly, ""and—and earls; don't you know?""

""Why, yes,"" returned Mr. Hobbs; ""we DID touch 'em up a little; that's so!""

Cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead. Nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life. He was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to Mr. Hobbs, too.

""You said,"" he proceeded, ""that you wouldn't have them sitting 'round on your cracker-barrels.""

""So I did!"" returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly. ""And I meant it. Let 'em try it—that's all!""

""Mr. Hobbs,"" said Cedric, ""one is sitting on this box now!""

Mr. Hobbs almost jumped out of his chair.

""What!"" he exclaimed.
""Yes,"" Cedric announced, with due modesty; ""I am one—or I am going to be. I won't deceive you.""

Mr. Hobbs looked agitated. He rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer.

""The mercury's got into your head!"" he exclaimed, turning back to examine his young friend's countenance. ""It IS a hot day! How do you feel?
Got any pain? When did you begin to feel that way?""

He put his big hand on the little boy's hair. This was more embarrassing than ever.

""Thank you,"" said Ceddie; ""I'm all right. There is nothing the matter with my head. I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs. That was what Mary came to take me home for. Mr. Havisham was telling my mamma, and he is a lawyer.""

Mr. Hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.

""ONE of us has got a sunstroke!"" he exclaimed.

""No,"" returned Cedric, ""we haven't. We shall have to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Havisham came all the way from England to tell us about it. My grandpapa sent him.""

Mr. Hobbs stared wildly at the innocent, serious little face before him.

""Who is your grandfather?"" he asked.

Cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper, on which something was written in his own round, irregular hand.
""I couldn't easily remember it, so I wrote it down on this,"" he said. And he read aloud slowly: ""'John Arthur Molyneux Errol, Earl of Dorincourt.' That is his name, and he lives in a castle—in two or three castles, I think. And my papa, who died, was his youngest son; and I shouldn't have been a lord or an earl if my papa hadn't died; and my papa wouldn't have been an earl if his two brothers hadn't died. But they all died, and there is no one but me,—no boy,—and so I have to be one; and my grandpapa has sent for me to come to England.""

Mr. Hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter. He mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard. He began to see that something very remarkable had happened; but when he looked at the little boy sitting on the cracker-box, with the innocent, anxious expression in his childish eyes, and saw that he was not changed at all, but was simply as he had been the day before, just a handsome, cheerful, brave little fellow in a blue suit and red neck-ribbon, all this information about the nobility bewildered him. He was all the more bewildered because Cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity, and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was.
""Wha—what did you say your name was?"" Mr. Hobbs inquired.

""It's Cedric Errol, Lord Fauntleroy,"" answered Cedric. ""That was what Mr. Havisham called me. He said when I went into the room: 'And so this is little Lord Fauntleroy!'""

""Well,"" said Mr. Hobbs, ""I'll be—jiggered!""

This was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited. He could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment.

Cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation. His respect and affection for Mr. Hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks. He had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes Mr. Hobbs was not quite conventional. He knew, of course, that he was different from his mamma, but, then, his mamma was a lady, and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen.

He looked at Mr. Hobbs wistfully.

""England is a long way off, isn't it?"" he asked.

""It's across the Atlantic Ocean,"" Mr. Hobbs answered.

""That's the worst of it,"" said Cedric. ""Perhaps I shall not see you again for a long time. I don't like to think of that, Mr. Hobbs.""

""The best of friends must part,"" said Mr. Hobbs.

""Well,"" said Cedric, ""we have been friends for a great many years, haven't we?""

""Ever since you was born,"" Mr. Hobbs answered. ""You was about six weeks old when you was first walked out on this street.""

""Ah,"" remarked Cedric, with a sigh, ""I never thought I should have to be an earl then!""

""You think,"" said Mr. Hobbs, ""there's no getting out of it?""

""I'm afraid not,"" answered Cedric. ""My mamma says that my papa would wish me to do it. But if I have to be an earl, there's one thing I can do: I can try to be a good one. I'm not going to be a tyrant. And if there is ever to be another war with America, I shall try to stop it.""
His conversation with Mr. Hobbs was a long and serious one. Once having got over the first shock, Mr. Hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected; he endeavored to resign himself to the situation, and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions. As Cedric could answer but few of them, he endeavored to answer them himself, and, being fairly launched on the subject of earls and marquises and lordly estates, explained many things in a way which would probably have astonished Mr. Havisham, could that gentleman have heard it.

But then there were many things which astonished Mr. Havisham. He had spent all his life in England, and was not accustomed to American people and American habits. He had been connected professionally with the family of the Earl of Dorincourt for nearly forty years, and he knew all about its grand estates and its great wealth and importance; and, in a cold, business-like way, he felt an interest in this little boy, who, in the future, was to be the master and owner of them all,—the future Earl of Dorincourt. He had known all about the old Earl's disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at Captain Cedric's American marriage, and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words. He insisted that she was only a common American girl, who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earl's son. The old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true. He had seen a great many selfish, mercenary people in his life, and he had not a good opinion of Americans. When he had been driven into the cheap street, and his coupe had stopped before the cheap, small house, he had felt actually shocked. It seemed really quite dreadful to think that the future owner of Dorincourt Castle and Wyndham Towers and Chorlworth, and all the other stately splendors, should have been born and brought up in an insignificant house in a street with a sort of green-grocery at the corner. He wondered what kind of a child he would be, and what kind of a mother he had. He rather shrank from seeing them both. He had a sort of pride in the noble family whose legal affairs he had conducted so long, and it would have annoyed him very much to have found himself obliged to manage a woman who would seem to him a vulgar, money-loving person, with no respect for her dead husband's country and the dignity of his name. It was a very old name and a very splendid one, and Mr. Havisham had a great respect for it himself, though he was only a cold, keen, business-like old lawyer.

When Mary handed him into the small parlor, he looked around it critically. It was plainly furnished, but it had a home-like look; there were no cheap, common ornaments, and no cheap, gaudy pictures; the few adornments on the walls were in good taste and about the room were many pretty things which a woman's hand might have made.

""Not at all bad so far,"" he had said to himself; ""but perhaps the Captain's taste predominated."" But when Mrs. Errol came into the room, he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it. If he had not been quite a self-contained and stiff old gentleman, he would probably have started when he saw her. She looked, in the simple black dress, fitting closely to her slender figure, more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven. She had a pretty, sorrowful, young face, and a very tender, innocent look in her large brown eyes,—the sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died. Cedric was used to seeing it there; the only times he had ever seen it fade out had been when he was playing with her or talking to her, and had said some old-fashioned thing, or used some long word he had picked up out of the newspapers or in his conversations with Mr. Hobbs. He was fond of using long words, and he was always pleased when they made her laugh, though he could not understand why they were laughable; they were quite serious matters with him. The lawyer's experience taught him to read people's characters very shrewdly, and as soon as he saw Cedric's mother he knew that the old Earl had made a great mistake in thinking her a vulgar, mercenary woman. Mr. Havisham had never been married, he had never even been in love, but he divined that this pretty young creature with the sweet voice and sad eyes had married Captain Errol only because she loved him with all her affectionate heart, and that she had never once thought it an advantage that he was an earl's son. And he saw he should have no trouble with her, and he began to feel that perhaps little Lord Fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family, after all. The Captain had been a handsome fellow, and the young mother was very pretty, and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at.

When he first told Mrs. Errol what he had come for, she turned very pale.

""Oh!"" she said; ""will he have to be taken away from me? We love each other so much! He is such a happiness to me! He is all I have. I have tried to be a good mother to him."" And her sweet young voice trembled, and the tears rushed into her eyes. ""You do not know what he has been to me!"" she said.

The lawyer cleared his throat.

""I am obliged to tell you,"" he said, ""that the Earl of Dorincourt is not—is not very friendly toward you. He is an old man, and his prejudices are very strong. He has always especially disliked America and Americans, and was very much enraged by his son's marriage. I am sorry to be the bearer of so unpleasant a communication, but he is very fixed in his determination not to see you. His plan is that Lord Fauntleroy shall be educated under his own supervision; that he shall live with him. The Earl is attached to Dorincourt Castle, and spends a great deal of time there. He is a victim to inflammatory gout, and is not fond of London. Lord Fauntleroy will, therefore, be likely to live chiefly at Dorincourt. The Earl offers you as a home Court Lodge, which is situated pleasantly, and is not very far from the castle. He also offers you a suitable income. Lord Fauntleroy will be permitted to visit you; the only stipulation is, that you shall not visit him or enter the park gates. You see you will not be really separated from your son, and I assure you, madam, the terms are not so harsh as—as they might have been. The advantage of such surroundings and education as Lord Fauntleroy will have, I am sure you must see, will be very great.""

He felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene, as he knew some women would have done. It embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry.

But she did not. She went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments, and he saw she was trying to steady herself.

""Captain Errol was very fond of Dorincourt,"" she said at last. ""He loved England, and everything English. It was always a grief to him that he was parted from his home. He was proud of his home, and of his name. He would wish—I know he would wish that his son should know the beautiful old places, and be brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his future position.""

Then she came back to the table and stood looking up at Mr. Havisham very gently.

""My husband would wish it,"" she said. ""It will be best for my little boy. I know—I am sure the Earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him not to love me; and I know—even if he tried—that my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed. He has a warm, faithful nature, and a true heart. He would love me even if he did not see me; and so long as we may see each other, I ought not to suffer very much.""
""She thinks very little of herself,"" the lawyer thought. ""She does not make any terms for herself.""

""Madam,"" he said aloud, ""I respect your consideration for your son. He will thank you for it when he is a man. I assure you Lord Fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded, and every effort will be used to insure his happiness. The Earl of Dorincourt will be as anxious for his comfort and well-being as you yourself could be.""

""I hope,"" said the tender little mother, in a rather broken voice, ""that his grandfather will love Ceddie. The little boy has a very affectionate nature; and he has always been loved.""

Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again. He could not quite imagine the gouty, fiery-tempered old Earl loving any one very much; but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind, in his irritable way, to the child who was to be his heir. He knew, too, that if Ceddie were at all a credit to his name, his grandfather would be proud of him.

""Lord Fauntleroy will be comfortable, I am sure,"" he replied. ""It was with a view to his happiness that the Earl desired that you should be near enough to him to see him frequently.""

He did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the Earl had used, which were in fact neither polite nor amiable.

Mr. Havisham preferred to express his noble patron's offer in smoother and more courteous language.

He had another slight shock when Mrs. Errol asked Mary to find her little boy and bring him to her, and Mary told her where he was.

""Sure I'll foind him aisy enough, ma'am,"" she said; ""for it's wid Mr. Hobbs he is this minnit, settin' on his high shtool by the counther an' talkin' pollytics, most loikely, or enj'yin' hisself among the soap an' candles an' pertaties, as sinsible an' shwate as ye plase.""

""Mr. Hobbs has known him all his life,"" Mrs. Errol said to the lawyer. ""He is very kind to Ceddie, and there is a great friendship between them.""

Remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it, and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends, Mr. Havisham felt his doubts arise again. In England, gentlemen's sons did not make friends of grocerymen, and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding. It would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company. One of the bitterest humiliations of the old Earl's life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company. Could it be, he thought, that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his father's good qualities?

He was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to Mrs. Errol until the child came into the room. When the door opened, he actually hesitated a moment before looking at Cedric. It would, perhaps, have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him, if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through Mr. Havisham when he looked down at the boy, who ran into his mother's arms. He experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting. He recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen.

His beauty was something unusual. He had a strong, lithe, graceful little body and a manly little face; he held his childish head up, and carried himself with a brave air; he was so like his father that it was really startling; he had his father's golden hair and his mother's brown eyes, but there was nothing sorrowful or timid in them. They were innocently fearless eyes; he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life.

""He is the best-bred-looking and handsomest little fellow I ever saw,"" was what Mr. Havisham thought. What he said aloud was simply, ""And so this is little Lord Fauntleroy.""

And, after this, the more he saw of little Lord Fauntleroy, the more of a surprise he found him. He knew very little about children, though he had seen plenty of them in England—fine, handsome, rosy girls and boys, who were strictly taken care of by their tutors and governesses, and who were sometimes shy, and sometimes a trifle boisterous, but never very interesting to a ceremonious, rigid old lawyer. Perhaps his personal interest in little Lord Fauntleroy's fortunes made him notice Ceddie more than he had noticed other children; but, however that was, he certainly found himself noticing him a great deal.

Cedric did not know he was being observed, and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner. He shook hands with Mr. Havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other, and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered Mr. Hobbs. He was neither shy nor bold, and when Mr. Havisham was talking to his mother, the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up.

""He seems to be a very mature little fellow,"" Mr. Havisham said to the mother.

""I think he is, in some things,"" she answered. ""He has always been very quick to learn, and he has lived a great deal with grownup people. He has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read in books, or has heard others use, but he is very fond of childish play. I think he is rather clever, but he is a very boyish little boy, sometimes.""

The next time Mr. Havisham met him, he saw that this last was quite true. As his coupe turned the corner, he caught sight of a group of small boys, who were evidently much excited. Two of them were about to run a race, and one of them was his young lordship, and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions. He stood side by side with another boy, one little red leg advanced a step.
""One, to make ready!"" yelled the starter. ""Two, to be steady. Three—and away!""

Mr. Havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest. He really never remembered having seen anything quite like the way in which his lordship's lordly little red legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he shot out in the race at the signal word. He shut his small hands and set his face against the wind; his bright hair streamed out behind.
""Hooray, Ced Errol!"" all the boys shouted, dancing and shrieking with excitement. ""Hooray, Billy Williams! Hooray, Ceddie! Hooray, Billy! Hooray! 'Ray! 'Ray!""

""I really believe he is going to win,"" said Mr. Havisham. The way in which the red legs flew and flashed up and down, the shrieks of the boys, the wild efforts of Billy Williams, whose brown legs were not to be despised, as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs, made him feel some excitement. ""I really—I really can't help hoping he will win!"" he said, with an apologetic sort of cough. At that moment, the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing, hopping boys. With one last frantic leap the future Earl of Dorincourt had reached the lamp-post at the end of the block and touched it, just two seconds before Billy Williams flung himself at it, panting.

""Three cheers for Ceddie Errol!"" yelled the little boys. ""Hooray for Ceddie Errol!""

Mr. Havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile.

""Bravo, Lord Fauntleroy!"" he said.

As his carriage stopped before the door of Mrs. Errol's house, the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it, attended by the clamoring crew. Cedric walked by Billy Williams and was speaking to him. His elated little face was very red, his curls clung to his hot, moist forehead, his hands were in his pockets.

""You see,"" he was saying, evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival, ""I guess I won because my legs are a little longer than yours. I guess that was it. You see, I'm three days older than you, and that gives me a 'vantage. I'm three days older.""

And this view of the case seemed to cheer Billy Williams so much that he began to smile on the world again, and felt able to swagger a little, almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it. Somehow, Ceddie Errol had a way of making people feel comfortable. Even in the first flush of his triumphs, he remembered that the person who was beaten might not feel so gay as he did, and might like to think that he MIGHT have been the winner under different circumstances.

That morning Mr. Havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the race—a conversation which made him smile his dry smile, and rub his chin with his bony hand several times.

Mrs. Errol had been called out of the parlor, and the lawyer and Cedric were left together. At first Mr. Havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion. He had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare Cedric for meeting his grandfather, and, perhaps, for the great change that was to come to him. He could see that Cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached England, or of the sort of home that waited for him there. He did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him. They had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him.

Mr. Havisham sat in an arm-chair on one side of the open window; on the other side was another still larger chair, and Cedric sat in that and looked at Mr. Havisham. He sat well back in the depths of his big seat, his curly head against the cushioned back, his legs crossed, and his hands thrust deep into his pockets, in a quite Mr. Hobbs-like way. He had been watching Mr. Havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room, and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness. There was a short silence after Mrs. Errol went out, and Cedric seemed to be studying Mr. Havisham, and Mr. Havisham was certainly studying Cedric. He could not make up his mind as to what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races, and wore short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it.

But Cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself.

""Do you know,"" he said, ""I don't know what an earl is?""

""Don't you?"" said Mr. Havisham.

""No,"" replied Ceddie. ""And I think when a boy is going to be one, he ought to know. Don't you?""

""Well—yes,"" answered Mr. Havisham.

""Would you mind,"" said Ceddie respectfully—""would you mind 'splaining it to me?"" (Sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly.) ""What made him an earl?""

""A king or queen, in the first place,"" said Mr. Havisham. ""Generally, he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign, or some great deed.""

""Oh!"" said Cedric; ""that's like the President.""

""Is it?"" said Mr. Havisham. ""Is that why your presidents are elected?""

""Yes,"" answered Ceddie cheerfully. ""When a man is very good and knows a great deal, he is elected president. They have torch-light processions and bands, and everybody makes speeches. I used to think I might perhaps be a president, but I never thought of being an earl. I didn't know about earls,"" he said, rather hastily, lest Mr. Havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be one,—""if I'd known about them, I dare say I should have thought I should like to be one.""

""It is rather different from being a president,"" said Mr. Havisham.

""Is it?"" asked Cedric. ""How? Are there no torch-light processions?""

Mr. Havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together. He thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly.

""An earl is—is a very important person,"" he began.

""So is a president!"" put in Ceddie. ""The torch-light processions are five miles long, and they shoot up rockets, and the band plays! Mr. Hobbs took me to see them.""

""An earl,"" Mr. Havisham went on, feeling rather uncertain of his ground, ""is frequently of very ancient lineage——""

""What's that?"" asked Ceddie.

""Of very old family—extremely old.""

""Ah!"" said Cedric, thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets. ""I suppose that is the way with the apple-woman near the park. I dare say she is of ancient lin-lenage. She is so old it would surprise you how she can stand up. She's a hundred, I should think, and yet she is out there when it rains, even. I'm sorry for her, and so are the other boys. Billy Williams once had nearly a dollar, and I asked him to buy five cents' worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all. That made twenty days, and he grew tired of apples after a week; but then—it was quite fortunate—a gentleman gave me fifty cents and I bought apples from her instead. You feel sorry for any one that's so poor and has such ancient lin-lenage. She says hers has gone into her bones and the rain makes it worse.""

Mr. Havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companion's innocent, serious little face.

""I am afraid you did not quite understand me,"" he explained. ""When I said 'ancient lineage' I did not mean old age; I meant that the name of such a family has been known in the world a long time; perhaps for hundreds of years persons bearing that name have been known and spoken of in the history of their country.""

""Like George Washington,"" said Ceddie. ""I've heard of him ever since I was born, and he was known about, long before that. Mr. Hobbs says he will never be forgotten. That's because of the Declaration of Independence, you know, and the Fourth of July. You see, he was a very brave man.""

""The first Earl of Dorincourt,"" said Mr. Havisham solemnly, ""was created an earl four hundred years ago.""

""Well, well!"" said Ceddie. ""That was a long time ago! Did you tell Dearest that? It would int'rust her very much. We'll tell her when she comes in. She always likes to hear cur'us things. What else does an earl do besides being created?""

""A great many of them have helped to govern England. Some of them have been brave men and have fought in great battles in the old days.""

""I should like to do that myself,"" said Cedric. ""My papa was a soldier, and he was a very brave man—as brave as George Washington. Perhaps that was because he would have been an earl if he hadn't died. I am glad earls are brave. That's a great 'vantage—to be a brave man. Once I used to be rather afraid of things—in the dark, you know; but when I thought about the soldiers in the Revolution and George Washington—it cured me.""

""There is another advantage in being an earl, sometimes,"" said Mr. Havisham slowly, and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression. ""Some earls have a great deal of money.""

He was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was.

""That's a good thing to have,"" said Ceddie innocently. ""I wish I had a great deal of money.""

""Do you?"" said Mr. Havisham. ""And why?""

""Well,"" explained Cedric, ""there are so many things a person can do with money. You see, there's the apple-woman. If I were very rich I should buy her a little tent to put her stall in, and a little stove, and then I should give her a dollar every morning it rained, so that she could afford to stay at home. And then—oh! I'd give her a shawl. And, you see, her bones wouldn't feel so badly. Her bones are not like our bones; they hurt her when she moves. It's very painful when your bones hurt you. If I were rich enough to do all those things for her, I guess her bones would be all right.""

""Ahem!"" said Mr. Havisham. ""And what else would you do if you were rich?""

""Oh! I'd do a great many things. Of course I should buy Dearest all sorts of beautiful things, needle-books and fans and gold thimbles and rings, and an encyclopedia, and a carriage, so that she needn't have to wait for the street-cars. If she liked pink silk dresses, I should buy her some, but she likes black best. But I'd, take her to the big stores, and tell her to look 'round and choose for herself. And then Dick——""
""Who is Dick?"" asked Mr. Havisham.

""Dick is a boot-black,"" said his young lordship, quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting. ""He is one of the nicest boot-blacks you ever knew. He stands at the corner of a street down-town. I've known him for years. Once when I was very little, I was walking out with Dearest, and she bought me a beautiful ball that bounced, and I was carrying it and it bounced into the middle of the street where the carriages and horses were, and I was so disappointed, I began to cry—I was very little. I had kilts on. And Dick was blacking a man's shoes, and he said 'Hello!' and he ran in between the horses and caught the ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said, 'It's all right, young un.' So Dearest admired him very much, and so did I, and ever since then, when we go down-town, we talk to him. He says 'Hello!' and I say 'Hello!' and then we talk a little, and he tells me how trade is. It's been bad lately.""

""And what would you like to do for him?"" inquired the lawyer, rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile.

""Well,"" said Lord Fauntleroy, settling himself in his chair with a business air, ""I'd buy Jake out.""

""And who is Jake?"" Mr. Havisham asked.

""He's Dick's partner, and he is the worst partner a fellow could have! Dick says so. He isn't a credit to the business, and he isn't square. He cheats, and that makes Dick mad. It would make you mad, you know, if you were blacking boots as hard as you could, and being square all the time, and your partner wasn't square at all. People like Dick, but they don't like Jake, and so sometimes they don't come twice. So if I were rich, I'd buy Jake out and get Dick a 'boss' sign—he says a 'boss' sign goes a long way; and I'd get him some new clothes and new brushes, and start him out fair. He says all he wants is to start out fair.""

There could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story, quoting his friend Dick's bits of slang in the most candid good faith. He seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself. And in truth Mr. Havisham was beginning to be greatly interested; but perhaps not quite so much in Dick and the apple-woman as in this kind little lordling, whose curly head was so busy, under its yellow thatch, with good-natured plans for his friends, and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether.

""Is there anything——"" he began. ""What would you get for yourself, if you were rich?""

""Lots of things!"" answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly; ""but first I'd give Mary some money for Bridget—that's her sister, with twelve children, and a husband out of work. She comes here and cries, and Dearest gives her things in a basket, and then she cries again, and says: 'Blessin's be on yez, for a beautiful lady.' And I think Mr. Hobbs would like a gold watch and chain to remember me by, and a meerschaum pipe. And then I'd like to get up a company.""

""A company!"" exclaimed Mr. Havisham.

""Like a Republican rally,"" explained Cedric, becoming quite excited. ""I'd have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself, too. And we'd march, you know, and drill. That's what I should like for myself, if I were rich.""

The door opened and Mrs. Errol came in.

""I am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long,"" she said to Mr. Havisham; ""but a poor woman, who is in great trouble, came to see me.""

""This young gentleman,"" said Mr. Havisham, ""has been telling me about some of his friends, and what he would do for them if he were rich.""

""Bridget is one of his friends,"" said Mrs. Errol; ""and it is Bridget to whom I have been talking in the kitchen. She is in great trouble now because her husband has rheumatic fever.""

Cedric slipped down out of his big chair.

""I think I'll go and see her,"" he said, ""and ask her how he is. He's a nice man when he is well. I'm obliged to him because he once made me a sword out of wood. He's a very talented man.""

He ran out of the room, and Mr. Havisham rose from his chair. He seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of.
He hesitated a moment, and then said, looking down at Mrs. Errol:

""Before I left Dorincourt Castle, I had an interview with the Earl, in which he gave me some instructions. He is desirous that his grandson should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in England, and also to his acquaintance with himself. He said that I must let his lordship know that the change in his life would bring him money and the pleasures children enjoy; if he expressed any wishes, I was to gratify them, and to tell him that his grand-father had given him what he wished. I am aware that the Earl did not expect anything quite like this; but if it would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure to assist this poor woman, I should feel that the Earl would be displeased if he were not gratified.""

For the second time, he did not repeat the Earl's exact words. His lordship had, indeed, said:

""Make the lad understand that I can give him anything he wants. Let him know what it is to be the grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt. Buy him everything he takes a fancy to; let him have money in his pockets, and tell him his grandfather put it there.""

His motives were far from being good, and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warm-hearted than little Lord Fauntleroy's, great harm might have been done. And Cedric's mother was too gentle to suspect any harm. She thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely, unhappy old man, whose children were dead, wished to be kind to her little boy, and win his love and confidence. And it pleased her very much to think that Ceddie would be able to help Bridget. It made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness. Quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face.

""Oh!"" she said, ""that was very kind of the Earl; Cedric will be so glad! He has always been fond of Bridget and Michael. They are quite deserving. I have often wished I had been able to help them more. Michael is a hard-working man when he is well, but he has been ill a long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing food. He and Bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them.""
Mr. Havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocket-book. There was a queer look in his keen face. The truth was, he was wondering what the Earl of Dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted. He wondered what the cross, worldly, selfish old nobleman would think of it.

""I do not know that you have realized,"" he said, ""that the Earl of Dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man. He can afford to gratify any caprice. I think it would please him to know that Lord Fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy. If you will call him back and allow me, I shall give him five pounds for these people.""

""That would be twenty-five dollars!"" exclaimed Mrs. Errol. ""It will seem like wealth to them. I can scarcely believe that it is true.""
""It is quite true,"" said Mr. Havisham, with his dry smile. ""A great change has taken place in your son's life, a great deal of power will lie in his hands.""

""Oh!"" cried his mother. ""And he is such a little boy—a very little boy. How can I teach him to use it well? It makes me half afraid. My pretty little Ceddie!""

The lawyer slightly cleared his throat. It touched his worldly, hard old heart to see the tender, timid look in her brown eyes.

""I think, madam,"" he said, ""that if I may judge from my interview with Lord Fauntleroy this morning, the next Earl of Dorincourt will think for others as well as for his noble self. He is only a child yet, but I think he may be trusted.""

Then his mother went for Cedric and brought him back into the parlor. Mr. Havisham heard him talking before he entered the room.
""It's infam-natory rheumatism,"" he was saying, ""and that's a kind of rheumatism that's dreadful. And he thinks about the rent not being paid, and Bridget says that makes the inf'ammation worse. And Pat could get a place in a store if he had some clothes.""

His little face looked quite anxious when he came in. He was very sorry for Bridget.

""Dearest said you wanted me,"" he said to Mr. Havisham. ""I've been talking to Bridget.""

Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment. He felt a little awkward and undecided. As Cedric's mother had said, he was a very little boy.
""The Earl of Dorincourt——"" he began, and then he glanced involuntarily at Mrs. Errol.

Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body.

""Ceddie,"" she said, ""the Earl is your grandpapa, your own papa's father. He is very, very kind, and he loves you and wishes you to love him, because the sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy. He is very rich, and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so, and gave him a great deal of money for you. You can give some to Bridget now; enough to pay her rent and buy Michael everything. Isn't that fine, Ceddie? Isn't he good?"" And she kissed the child on his round cheek, where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement.

He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham.

""Can I have it now?"" he cried. ""Can I give it to her this minute? She's just going.""

Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in fresh, clean greenbacks and made a neat roll.

Ceddie flew out of the room with it.

""Bridget!"" they heard him shout, as he tore into the kitchen. ""Bridget, wait a minute! Here's some money. It's for you, and you can pay the rent. My grandpapa gave it to me. It's for you and Michael!""

""Oh, Master Ceddie!"" cried Bridget, in an awe-stricken voice. ""It's twinty-foive dollars is here. Where be's the misthress?""

""I think I shall have to go and explain it to her,"" Mrs. Errol said.

So she, too, went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for a while. He went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively. He was thinking of the old Earl of Dorincourt, sitting in his great, splendid, gloomy library at the castle, gouty and lonely, surrounded by grandeur and luxury, but not really loved by any one, because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but himself; he had been selfish and self-indulgent and arrogant and passionate; he had cared so much for the Earl of Dorincourt and his pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people; all his wealth and power, all the benefits from his noble name and high rank, had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give pleasure to the Earl of Dorincourt; and now that he was an old man, all this excitement and self-indulgence had only brought him ill health and irritability and a dislike of the world, which certainly disliked him. In spite of all his splendor, there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the Earl of Dorincourt, and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one. He could fill his castle with guests if he chose. He could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties; but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic, biting speeches. He had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature, and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable, when he had the power to do so, because they were sensitive or proud or timid.

Mr. Havisham knew his hard, fierce ways by heart, and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow, quiet street. And there rose in his mind, in sharp contrast, the picture of the cheery, handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of his friends, Dick and the apple-woman, in his generous, innocent, honest way. And he thought of the immense income, the beautiful, majestic estates, the wealth, and power for good or evil, which in the course of time would lie in the small, chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust so deep into his pockets.

""It will make a great difference,"" he said to himself. ""It will make a great difference.""

Cedric and his mother came back soon after. Cedric was in high spirits. He sat down in his own chair, between his mother and the lawyer, and fell into one of his quaint attitudes, with his hands on his knees. He was glowing with enjoyment of Bridget's relief and rapture.

""She cried!"" he said. ""She said she was crying for joy! I never saw any one cry for joy before. My grandpapa must be a very good man. I didn't know he was so good a man. It's more—more agreeabler to be an earl than I thought it was. I'm almost glad—I'm almost QUITE glad I'm going to be one.""Embed"

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

I'm a old soul trapped in a young body

Like my ancestors I can make anything outta nothin'
Mental telepathy, who can mess with me
The game's foul that's why I'm blowin' like a referee
On the best of trees, found across the 7 seas
90s baby but the flow jazzy like the 70's
If you C me dont say A, just let me B
I'm headin' towards greatness I'm manifestin' my destiny
Keep it a hunnid im hot and you in the 70s
Keep the heat around cuz I ain't tryna meet persephone
Now a days the streets faulty like old wires
I'm no gangster still ready to bust like old tires
Boy I'm no liar, please dont try us
You'll get burnt tryna hold fire

Mentally imprisoned, you only free when you go to the grave
Enslavement then and now is one in the same
First they give u a whip then they through on a chain
Then u rap about clips and its blows up your name
You end up with a chick, whos more in love with your fame
When its gone she'll split, she ain't got nothin to gain
They say life is a bitch, and u fell in love with her mane
Thats when you wake from yo dream, and enter this nightmare

Get caught in the streets and you ain't gettin yo life spared
Funny you thought the only thing in check was yo nike airs

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)

77,The One That Got Away - Acoustic,Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection,Katy Perry,Sad,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

78,Please Remember Me,Please Remember Me,Ashley Jessica,Sad,"Please, remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

[Verse 2]
But please, remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates had some eloquent graffiti
Like ""We'll meet again"" and ""Fuck the man""
And ""Tell my mother not to worry""
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

[Verse 3]
And please, remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city
See Iron & Wine LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Verse 4]
So please, remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like ""Lost and found"" and ""Don't look down""
And ""Someone save temptation""

[Verse 5]
And please, remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

[Verse 6]
But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
""Who the hell can see forever?""
[Verse 7]
And please, remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, ""The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last"", the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

[Verse 8]
So please, remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger12Embed"

And I won't ever let you go

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street

93,Arcade,Arcade,Duncan Laurence,Sad,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

This is a story I hate
And tellin' it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out

[Pre-Chorus]
I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

[Chorus]
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?

Instead of hittin' bro with your diss lines and now they book you for World Dom' 8
Great
Well let's see if iron in ya face gets you emotional this time
Pussy this bit, it's mine
I seen ya tweets, clowin', oh there's different levels when we spit lines? Cool
Now I'm heated, so for here on out, shit's peak I fly in and bombin' him; blitzkrieg
I'll bury this pipsqueak, prick deep
Now you can finally say that you six feet
It won't bring him back
I swing a bat it's a body, takfuckinge a piss is what the kid needs (kidneys)
Then he'll get the TECs (texts), but there'll be no TECs (text) back
You know how these chicks be, bitch please
Clownin' my bars from years ago, that shit's weak
Spittin' woefully average multisyllabics like, ""You ain't a big Neek""
You fuckin' backpacker
You cry online ever fuckingy time you lose to a black rapper
We all seen it
Liking racist shit when the fans tweet crud
Prolly think they got a point about the hood when the Klan meet up
Damn he fucked
You gettin' the Rum Nitty treatment
That's back to back punches 'til my hands seize (C's) up
Yank fans ease up before I prove you're a lady
Listen, both our countries speak English we just don't use it the same
I don't care who in the Dot over I, it's my time to capitalize, cause that's what you do with a name
No more games
Yo, no more lame Hattori Hanzo bars, we get it
You sharp, deadly, see trouble, get drawn
But see hammerin' that steel angle is a double edged sword
I make you bite the blade, right away
So much blood in your mouth it's gross, that's your death wish
Like ya ex-bitch, I'll bring up one good point and keep shovin' it down your throat!
There is no way you're the GOAT
Just some pampered kid, lay your head out
Start stampin' it
Then it's a shallow grave, grab a spade, throwin' peat (Pete) on top of you like every rankings list
When you two battled
It's like he's playin' harps center stage and you playin' viola with your friends in middle
Get it?
He up front pullin' strings, you stuck in the back playin' second fiddle
I mean you got some bark but you're weak
You lack the heart of a beast, you're no Kung Lao
But hats off, you were sharp at your peak
But this is where your path ends at your streak
Especially when your next battlin' A. Ward
After this, they might have to host your next battle in a ward
So take your shots
Just make sure you popped a hit
Or there will be no bright side 'Mac I am not an op' to miss (optimist)
I switched the Matte black to the nickle plate
Wasn't even sure if they'd like that move
Turns out It reflect well with the glove, now I got a Mike Jack' groove
Which is funny, cause it's no longer black but still slide back smooth
Dude mock me all you want, my pen is driven
I make movies black with words so when the end credits given
That's why I stay walkin' wit' a vets
Punches will knock teeth loose, you end up swallowin' the rest
See your life ends with a box, you Apollo in ya death
Math Hoffa, I'm a Rare Breed you gettin' a Hollow in the vest
So go ahead Greg, you in London now, say what you need to say

Cause as far as being GOAT in this battling thing
I guess I am Kung Lao cause I gotta throw my hat in the ring
And he tried to call me ""nerdy"" like that was true speech
You act like you different, what you think you 'Neek (unique)?
Fuck it, right?
Some people think you beat Tony D
You did, I cannot front on him
I gotta dope lines for you and that's not one of 'em
Straight to it, you can't listen without thought
Well think Inception this ya dream profession
And this scenes the endin', I'm scriptin' it out, watch
Before I give him credit I leave him hangin'
Told him (totem) if this was about props, in the end any way you spin it you only get a round tops
The animals out, he has a cow (cal') perfect, pull out ox
Sheep in wolf's clothing, the GOAT, the last person you'd outfox
Fuck a pig, I don't act nervous around cops
Bag purple the drought stops
I live in LA, fuck his name, drop him past curfew around Watts
It feel electric for you like a Tesla coil when I (w)rap circles around shocks (Shox)
It's easy money, I got him movin' pounds from his safe like a London bank
I guess that makes me the boss then (Boston) I run this place
If there's not a tax from the British I'm the one you thank
Think I'm goin' overboard, push him from the plank
Tee (tea) off when the British Rebels boat (bolt)
Should've seen that comin' from a Yank'
Yo he stallin' (Stalin) like he run in place, leave marks on him parks on him with a Russian tank
My adrenaline too much to take
No way to chase him I'm Jason Statham for a bump of Crank
Pop his ego, air him out, make his lungs deflate
Body baggin' last trip, y'all see me gassin' air his Soul (aerosol) like huffin' paint
Gut is scrappin' hungry, my stomach ate
This is my one escape, watch how you conduct yourself
Surprise Shox (shocks) with the hands like the buzzer prank
Above his rank, come and take food from his plate
I robbed him once and told him he wasn't safe
Should've seen his fuckin' face when I robbed him again, it was a double take
Bolo kick when his broke nose drip
That'll be my first international solo hit
We not gon' box, who you tryin' to throw blows with?
Get jumped in the street when I stomp on Shox (shocks) like a Pogo stick
Showboat, rose gold wrist
Feel like the God of time when the chronos tick
Bro bro the scope won't miss
Spread gun get everyone a shot like a GoPro flick
Now Austin Powers askin' where his mojo went
His whole flow so old but fans will praise (appraise) it on some 'Antique Roadshow' shit
I'm dolo, in the big body like Brock Lesnar
Gettin' paid to talk to the dead I'm John Edward
Hot tempered, hook in his head; pop record
Wig on him, now he goin' out like a bitch; cross dresser
Dawg, our stats do not measure
It's no secret, you're not better
I'm confident you'll know I'm above your class if I (classified) go off record
I've been through a lot, came from a lot lesser
Was taught pressure turn coal to diamonds, shit then I'm lost treasure
I turn my goals into gold mindin' (mining) my business like prospectors
Dig it, my mind stresses the Loch Ness I'll bear paw you'll get pallbearers soon as your thoughts rendered
You got set up, cause terror, arm, leg a, leg a, arm, head I'm god head of a lost era
Him bar with me? Not never
This far fetched as Shox in a lost sweater, reading [?] walkin' across Mecca
Dawg, I didn't even use, ""Dear John letters"", ""Salt/pepper""
""Rochester"", ""dog catcher"", ""hawk feather"", ""draw better than Carl Brenner""
I said I didn't even use ""Dear John letters"", ""Salt/pepper""
""Rochester"", ""hawk feather"", ""hot stepper"", ""draw better than Carl Brenner""
I didn't use ""bartender"", ""swap genders"", ""car fender"", ""arm wrestler"", ""fall weather"", ""John Denver"", ""bomb threat"" or ""God's letter""

[Round 2: Shox The Rebel]
Sounded lovely that, dinnitit?

[Illmac]
Goddamn right. Every round

[Shox The Rebel]
Can't lie when I was writin' this I was goin' through some shit
Pain one step past the normal
I should get an award for how much I drove my Lady Gaga
But that's how a Star Is Born
To be honest with you, I'm bored of this ride I wanna get off this
Tired of cuttin' keys like a locksmith
Bein' forced to pull the MF Doom, put on a mask to spit hot shit
But honestly, I got a problem with your ego man
You think cause you pennin' rounds on diesel you can clown your equals
The irony, a midget lookin' down on people
But I guess you just love to be little (belittle)
It's funny, after givin' all that props on that Watch, that was a mad sight
Soon as the battle's locked you turn to Michelangelo when the candles glow, tryin' to paint me in a bad light
So concerned with a 3-0, it's quite tragic
Sat down, penciled the body just to die like Leo' in Titanic
Aye 'Ganik, don't you think his arrogance is a real shame within the scene
You lettin' him dictate how this card's run and he ain't even got a place within the team
But they treat you sweet, droppin' bars, long as you're makin' them the P
To be exact money, I guess there's no change in (changin') the machine
But look...they sleepin'
Here's the saddest fact, you do not exist outside of battle rap, you have no life
No digs, no wife
No kids you just get high and spit
Am I lyin'?
[?] to give you an opponent that he put the heart in it
So desperate to burn 'em all like an arsonist
But soon as you step off stage, you go home and it's cryin' on a shoulder
So I'ma send you home with a flag taped on your coffin for tryin' to be the soldier
{chokes}
You tried to charge more for this battle, then he make the event crumble it's a fable
Don't wanna chess move, that was a game of pool
Cause you wouldn't stick to the round numbers on the table
Cause you're eager to claim legend, but that statement don't work with your wealth
So it's like that Momo hoax, cause now I'm sendin' you a message and you just hurtin' yourself
I know better than to say ""you're shit""
But if you copy Gemin1's angle it won't save ya kid
You pick up a pen and say that I copy then you played your wrist (plagiarist)
But you'll pander, cause they're open minded to it
See I've spat like a million punches, I really grind to do it
If a line ain't as good as my own I'll be out my fuckin' mind to use it
This shit's like pin the tail on the donkey
Pushin' one tacky point cause you blinded to it
But I ain't like you spittin' guys, I'm from a different time
Different height, hop in the whip and ride
Leave my ops soakin' in the trunk so they slip and slide
Don't ever question my loyalty 'Mac, I got no problem pickin' sides
So you get the blade or escape, pick one my brother
But if you see me on a Snow Patrol
Just do a Leona Lewis and pick 'Run' for cover
Cause I'm quick to flip at the beef, run a kid from the streets
If you makin' me Chase more (Moore) you gettin' hit with the beats
So keep ya distance, I'll rate your hand 'til you have some
You went from battlin' a Soul to battlin' a man who doesn't have one
I'm sick, I hope the kid got immunized
I mean you asked for this, so in more than one way that was short sighted and ill advised
Fuck what your fans say I haven't earned him
That lit a match and now I'm burnin'
But watch them infer no (inferno) knowledge after I'm earned (urned) him
Time, my apologies man. Time

[Round 2: Illmac]
You said I would copy an angle, don't ever disrespect me son
I mean even though Gem' had won I would never copy Gem in 1 (Gemin1)
But I watched the battle; Gem in 1
Look, you had to know this was comin'
He told Lu Cipher, ""Eight lines connect to a body overseas like a fruit spider""
So we just callin' ""legs"" ""lines"" now?
Well tell your bitch to keep her lines down!
I mean...what? Did I cross the leg?
You waste all your energy punchin', I'm not gonna waste mine
You force wordplay, context, different concepts that you make rhyme
The reach don't mean shit, get clocked dead in your face
Why? You go outta your way for the punch, to be complex but I save time
Cause the shortest distance between two objects is a straight line!
Straight leg, whatever
Look, fans wanna be moved when the hit land
But when you force shit it's like a suppressor
When you blast and feel the kick back
It softens the blow like an airbag when you crash and feel the whiplash
All I'm sayin' is, yeah it's been a rough road traveled and I get that
But no, they don't need Shox (shocks) cause they'd rather feel the impact
Switch that, he throws a lot of hits and gets fucked up, then comes from the fight mangled
Yeah Shox is snappin', it's a boxer scratcher, cause you never punch with the right angle
Look, speakin' of, you got the Don't Flop title
Whoo, tell us, did it help with the fame?
Where's it at can we see it? Is it a trophy? Is it a belt or a chain?
Is it nothing?

You can say it, they know, you can say it

Even Grind Time had a shirt
Even Dan's league got a belt
You beat a claw machine you get a stuffed animal, nothin' fancy but it helps
How you win...nothing, go home and celebrate?
The worst part, what's that message say?
You work hard with all the time and energy you dedicate to your art
And maybe one day you might earn a...special place in Eurgh's heart
How does that work? Please explain it Shox
That's like winning the lottery then being paid in props
Yo, I bet he treats his rhyme book like a family photo album
Nostalgic, thumbing through loose leafs
His title is a family heirloom , future generations passing down a Youtube link
Shox, watch the Air Guitar Championships, it's literally their job to pretend
Funny thing is, whoever wins the title gets an actual guitar at the end
Think about that, they win an actual trophy pretending, in a sense they've done nothing
You actually battle, become champ and then have to pretend that you won something
Alright look, we'll get back to that
You can add up all his shitty schemes to see how big our difference seems
He's completely average, my shit is mean
He make less noise in the British scene than Mr. Bean
Drivin' up, light him up, hit the beam
Pop pop, non-stop, pistol's scream
The fully auto body Shox like a chop shop that strip him clean
Kiss the rings, brains on the wall like silly string
This is what happens when you die in a dream
The moment you're dead in the moment you realize it, he's somewhere in-between
I'm sippin' Hen', legendary OG, the pack is wintergreen
Gettin' rats movin' weight, my triple beam like a Smith machine
But him?
This little needle nose scoundrel, I ain't think he was this bad
My bad for bein' so doubtful
The truth is that's my bad for being so doubtful
And yeah you don't have a Soul, when I'm finished beatin' the Soul out you!
Time!

[Round 3: Shox The Rebel]
So you goin' for Champion Of The Year 2019, huh?

[Illmac]
That'd be lit

[Shox]
For those hopin' it's him, it's about to be a celebrity death match
I came to stop motion in the ring
You and Soul had a classic, honestly that match amazin'
He a better writer than me, but that's not the comparison we're makin'
See they bookin' him to spit beautiful multis, they booked me to smash ya face in
The streets got my brain gone, I lost a lot of my vast components
I've been set in the dark pennin' these bars on the coffins of my last opponents
{Chokes}

I'm so sorry man

[Illmac]
You got this

[Shox]
BAOW!

You get a headshot tryin' to escape, you'll be deceased if you run
I lick one in the air like, ""Where's all that breeze comin' from?""
Day dreams of rammin' a blade through his skull
Hop in the whip, jump on the throttle
I might have to hammer it through though
Shit lookin' like the sauce stuck in the bottle
{Chokes}

Sorry man

[Illmac]
It's good man,  you got it

[Shox]
Death came but he doubted, I left covered in blood
I guess he really is brains of the outfit

{Chokes}

So sorry man

Just bring padding for the scars
I'm Bruce Lee with a wooden body, I'm rapid with the bars
Full contact, fuck a contract, catch him slap him with the palm
Or I'll take this genie out the blue like Aladdin and Jafar
He's actin' that he's hard
You wanna jump start and catch a battery charge
I'll kill him, they say I won't cause dude is able
But either way I punch harder
Said our move is fatal
When you got metal rounds you ain't gotta swing back and forth like a Newton's cradle
Never mind all that
I'll rock a fake; Spinal Tap
The heat lay him out on the hood; vinyl wrap
500 round drum, his mind'll crack
Brain matter, 'Dancing On The Ceiling' like a Lionel track
Now I got violent bars, you stick to the angle and leak ya shit
I'm stuck in a violent past, that's why I struggle
Close my eyes when I climb into bed
My mind is mess and constantly tryin' to fight the violent descendants
Scene so grimace, too foul to repent
Tryin' to force down the bottle like I'm a celeb
See they picked you the vic', to fly in a jet
Put numbers over my name without writin' a check
But what's the point in givin' the time if your soul ain't rewarded for the time that you spent?
So I think that it's time that I rest
Go home, look at my kids, remind myself why I'm blessed
With that bein' said, R.I.P. Bender
I remember
Our paths crossed in London both times that we met
Always share a drink outside the event

Aw fuck man. Don't waste that for him

R.I.P. Bender
I remember
Our paths crossed lines when we met
We shared a drink outside the event
You told me I had fire in the pen, I still got the screenshots
From the time that you sent Organik
Message to try to get me lined for events
So my brother, just know that you've inspired us time and again
So please, everybody raise a drink high for the best
To Bender

So sorry man

[Round 3: Illmac]
Yo, that's how you could tell he's on some real Rebel shit
He was chokin' on purpose so the people at home didn't watch my rounds, that's some next level shit
That's why there's no use even battlin' this clown
Shox Da Rebel, rebelling against...rappin' in his rounds
This ain't about you, my bones is shatter proof
Soul is flammable
This fire invoked couldn't hold a Roman Candle to
Molten magma spew, A Titan throwin' Saturn's moons
Kiss the rings like the Pope put his hands on you
Holy attribute, blowin' ash, make a golden calf of you
Noah, I roll with animals, wolves and Malamutes
Death row him, go and strangle you
Roll like Hannibal on the backs of Woolly Mammoths marchin' on the Roman capitol
Fly in lower altitudes
Why? I hold an attitude
I go to stabbin' you, I put butterflies in your stomach like the moment's magical
You still alive? Show some gratitude
Heart made of frost, cold shoulder, travel through and skate across your frozen talent pool
Gordon Bombay, blade in the sneaks, Charlie Conway
You fake as a triple D
Y'all put money first then switch up, loyalty isn't cheap
Keep it 100 for them bold faces, you'll switch Mystiques
If it's beef, I don't get police
Dump his body in Venice Beach
I won't mourn over your death so don't give me grief
Slick as grease, you slept on a beast
Leonard printed sheets
Twist the leave, windows tinted, I'm in it with a freak
Trim physique, thick as thieves
My miss (Ms) Incredible, she won't mind stretchin' you, plus you just as quick to reach
Look, this your favorite hero? I'll Christopher Reeves him
Cut your life line, get the umbilical treatment
Read my contract killer, we had different agreements
Right Said Fred, I just came to do a hit then I'm leavin'
I could do this all day, you think this is competin'?
It's my show, your rounds are just intermissions between it
So why diss him directly? Give me a reason
Generic dissin' for generic bitches, consider us even
It gets worse for you
Feel ashamed, I spit a verse for you
Being vague, if this applied to another person on this Earth
You seem the same so take it personal either way
I mean, you ain't even worth this throw away verse
You ain't worth the indirects that I wrote in this third
Just like you ain't worth that trophy from Eurgh
For the meaningless title that you supposedly earned
Look at his face closer, all I see is a blank poster
A placeholder that blends in with all the other plain vultures
Pickin' off the roadkill in this raped culture
The same three styles from the same donors
No Rebel alliance when The Clone Wars take over
Originality dyin' a slow death 'til it's game over, that ain't kosher
Maybe when the caskets close then it's in the grave lower
Y'all can spot the difference from the great pose and the great posers
Y'all like clowns up in the circus runnin' around without a purpose
I've been around for every round you watched I jotted down a thousand verses
Never went out of bounds, was down and out it wasn't perfect
Seen different eras, different crowds
I'm different now cause I've been learnin'
Rounded out a person be proud of how I'm workin'
Relevant a decade plus
The ups the downs them Blackouts and then the surges
It build a powerhouse, my styles the now, it's current
So why the fuck would I feel shocks (Shox) when I'm so grounded in the circuit!

102,This Town,Flicker (Deluxe),Niall Horan,Sad,"Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you96Embed"

I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)

104,Be Alright,Be Alright,Dean Lewis,Sad,"I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know

Someone's talkin' back
Yeah, they're talkin' back, oh

107,Without Me,Without Me,Halsey,Sad,"Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

My hand on your seat the whole way round
I carry Band-Aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touchin' the ground
Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you

[Verse 2]
Lettin' go, lettin' go
Tellin' you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Askin' you where you want us to go
You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this comin' off in a cheesy way?

Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

110,my tears ricochet,folklore,Taylor Swift,Sad,"We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet91Embed"
113,Without You,Born To Die - The Paradise Edition,Lana Del Rey,Sad,"Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous?

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello? Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I have nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Verse 2]
Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined, my heart
But burned into my brain, all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it, babe, that life we could've lived?

[Chorus]

133,When You're Gone,The Best Damn Thing (Expanded Edition),Avril Lavigne,Sad,"I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
When you're gone, the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you

And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

It comes and goes in waves
It always does, always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

144,Water Fountain,Narrated For You,Alec Benjamin,Sad,"She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

[Pre-Chorus]
Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

[Chorus]
She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold
She'd say

They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say

I know she'd never leave me, and I hate to see her cry

She said, ""You're dancing in the movies""
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction

And now my heart's been stolen

You wrote them for me

When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again?
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?
Can I be him?

I heard there was someone but I know he don't deserve you

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table

Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

Hope you really know that I mean that

204,How Do I Say Goodbye,How Do I Say Goodbye,Dean Lewis,Sad,"Early mornin' there's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying ""Darlin', please come home""
I fear the worst, but how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say, but there's so little time

[Chorus]
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

[Verse 2]
When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And I promise, if you go
I will make sure she's alright

[Chorus]
So how do I say goodbye

You were So Fine

You didn't wanna let me know
Cause you know the way
Your love fades away
But it's alright
I can feel it by your side
Feel it all night
I don't wanna let you go and you know it
Showed me how to love when I was so hopeless
Made you feel seen when you were so lonely
Now I gotta let you go
Cause I know the way that you lie girl
I can't be by your side girl
And now I gotta decide
Cause you wanna play with my mind
Now I'm climbing to the top
Even though I'm so done
Sipping on Henny
Feeling so Numb
Doing these shows I am feeling so livid
Yeah you'll know that I was the one yeah

[Chorus - Lalo Gee & Kayze]
Your love is that Cold Love

Even though you break my heart
I cannot let you go
I cannot let you go
Your love is colder than mars
With you I am feeling alone
With you I'm felling so cold
Even though you break my heart
I cannot let you go
Your love is colder than mars
With you I am feeling alone
With you I'm feeling so cold
It's bout that time I go
With you is not my home
So I gotta let you go

242,Band Aid,XVIII,Jan Metternich,Sad,"
Don't wanna hear no more that I turned to another person
They keep calling my phone, yeah I'm swerving
I'm done with them all they do is hurt me, hurt me yeah yeah

I feel my heart's been hurting, need a band aid
You say you're sorry but you're too late
You know a change have come, I guess I blame it on the fate
The thing that once was love, now seems to turn to hate
Yeah yeah, she said that it's all in my head but you ignore me and now we act like Enemies
I gotta hold me up somеwhere I don't think about you

I know you're not minе anymore officially
I know it's time for me to break up with all my misery
You just left me at a time you could be my remedy
You like music to my ear you're necessarily

Who needs more out of life
Oh girl you are someone
That has me moving you're divine

(Verse 1: CMMONK)
You quiet like inky light like lightening cloud
Been outside of this clique don't you wanna come with me different vice and style?
I have art in my blood and I do it excellent when I discover new bounds
Now all I want to do is be myself
An expression to be self expressive wear no shell
I don't know enough about you but I wanna help
I'm not coming up to front like you are so unwell
You are trusting me lucky me I guess wow
Yeah I guess we make it immediate now
I know you plan on staying home this evening
I knock on your door you ask what is the meaning?
I want to take you out this evening we're leaving to stop you from feeling

(Verse 2: CMMONK)
This is how it is going to be just me and you
Let's vacate the world for the ages girl your dress is a graceful pearl
Blue you whirl in front of the mirror your dark hair has a great deal of interlacing curls
You're excited I can tell the way you twirl around the tree into me
As this day is where we make more of a connection just between us a lot deeper it's sweet
But being the only two in this run down area so called street
I refuse to live in a merry land with no variance it's bleak

And I swear it almost read bang said bully and then ran
Now you're running for your life girl forget what I said back then
'Cos me and you were so close and me and you are still cool
Yeah you need me in your life girl
I'm strong as about ten but your doubts got me acting
You say I really, really like you
Come with me and watch the tides turn
I know I'm not the right age
But I'm very nearly iced out and I hope you see it my way
Cos it's difficult to find you
Yeah walking pass I might swerve
I really want to suprise you
You were always on my side then
Let me take you back to my world
Let me world become yours then

She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette

[Verse: Mason]
Passion is nothing if you ain't got the heart to prove it
Life ain't always on cruise but I love it and do not confuse it
I figured out that you don’t gotta take a shot to do it
But when all this shit comes for free how do you not abuse it
Y'all don't know the half this life I still would chose it
So fuck all that I got my cities back so let's do this
Gifted Records, I’m guessing you'll never doubt for a second
Now that we're grabbing the mics, we've got all your attention
Y'all probably aw struck, that's just what I'm guessing
As I watch all their jaws drop, listen to what I say for second
Man all these bitches so cocky coming out with the freestyle
I sat back for a meanwhile and developed a mean style
Now a mix of Schoolboy and Rocky, y'all just old and senile
I got an electric body and I'll shit on a green mile
We've got the strongest team but I’ll bet you’ve never heard us
Still wondering if I should carry the burden
Do I get attention if I commit a couple murders
Man what I gotta do to make it
Tell em I've been around since the 80's
Tell all the ladies that I got a Bugatti with a fellow Mercedes
Maybe wrote section 80
Hop on the internet and beg all the people to play me
Say I make a mil every time that they pay me
Or act like I made it, like 10 outta 10 what they rate me
Nah we fight to get by cause money's spent on the times
We'll get drunk and get high until there's light in the sky
Still we'll stick to our grind hip-hop till I’m blind
You ain't gifted you falling behind as we occupy all the skies
All the way up to cloud 9 two kids game changing with rhyme
Fuck the world it ain’t for you or Nas bitch the world's all mine
And y'all are not gonna knock us off
So step off, you can bet all, you want but you're dead wrong
I said songs are like lead bombs
Now I'm hear to test all that get off
Dissing these next stars
Because as soon as you hear this
I'll be in a Benz with three gear shifts
In other words I got a lot of drive inside
So hop off, or come along for the ride
And I’m not gonna stall
See I'm on to you all
Shoot straight for your abdominal wall
While ya mama fondles my balls
As I wonder the halls
Not many answer but still I call to you all
Think on the ups, and ponder the falls
Believe it or not I am still dreaming
I start to believe that I can succeed
When y'all could say that you're leaving
My heart will still beat and defeat
All the demons I am still breathing
Was weak, now a week at a time I see the light through my speech
Speak my mind to these streets handle all of this heat
Backed up by an entire fleet of liars and cheats
That seek to murder these beats
Throw them headphones down our sound is way to complete
Fuck up the speakers we still can
Trots, YBG, Jared, and Milk Man
We’ll handle all of it easily, this shit is a breeze to me
I'm dreaming for reasons that mean this the season is beating me
I just stick to the beat and we continue to speak to these
People no steeple will keep us from reaching these
Heights that we aim for, cause I never aim low
Get what we came for
The game might be tame somewhere over the rainbow
But not here, so grab your gear, live in fear when I'm near
Steer clear, throw it to fifth gear get the fuck outta here
This is our year
And we're not gonna stop bitches hop off the cock
We'll take out a whole city square ya we'll knock off your block
These streets about to get hit with a heat wave
What do rappers even talk about these days
I ain't gonna brag about all of the money we made
I ain't made nothing yet, but keep an eye on them beats Dre
But lately I'm facing
A wall at every step as I'm pacing
Feel like it's against the clock I'm racing
I continue to fall behind and I'm chasing
A dream that I once had so long ago
Before the late nights and the alcohol
Before my friends and me all went broke
That summer smoking weed watching the world go
But none of that matters when the clock strikes three
Try to fuck with me you catch disease
I mean try to fuck me you catching STD's
Psych, but I don’t give no fucks don’t try to battle with me
So fuck an applause, and don’t try to appease
When I’m around teeth chatter something happened to me
Gotta meet a quota for beating on these
People who always seem to wanna be me
I'm bout to shut 'em all up and say, Welcome to PG

Breaking through the glass, it hurts
Anyone can stand there for a while
Making faces and lit up in style
So I tried to be there through this life
Even through your troubled times
Tried to listen up and be your friend
But you had reflections to defend
Ran when your self-image bent
Babe, how could you know me then?

Maybe you know me now
Maybe you know me now
I'd never bring you down
Maybe you know me now
They say you're lonely now
Maybe you know me now

Giving you that deep Taurus love
Even though I bled I could be strong
Always felt I was where I belong

I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy, but it's hard sometimes
It's hard sometimes

[Verse 2]
When I come off cold
I'm not doing it on purpose
You caught me in a hole
That I dig for myself when I'm nervous
I've been on the road, I've been missing home
See it on my phone that my friends back there
Got inside jokes without me
Oh woah
Don't mean to come off cold
I don't want to be alone

Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy, but it's hard sometimes (Hard sometimes)
But life (But life)
Just seems to happen right before my eyes (Before my eyes)
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy, but it's hard sometimes (Hard sometimes)

[Bridge]
I don't feel like myself and
I can't help being selfish
Sometimes, the pressure gets the best of me
Oh I, oh I

[Chorus]
Oh I
Try to be happy, but it's hard sometimes
But life
Just seems to happen, it's just passing by, oh
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy, but it's hard sometimes (Hard sometimes)

292,Still,Heartbreak Weather,Niall Horan,Sad,"My mind is complicated
Find it hard to rearrange it
But I'll have to find a way somehow
Overreacting lately
Find it hard to say I'm sorry
But I'll make it up to you somehow
I just don't know why
Stars won't shine at night

[Chorus]
Tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
Did I miscalculate this?
Let's just go back to basics
Forget about what's come and gone
'Cause I hate to see us like this
Breaking up on nights just like this
We should be shooting for them stars of gold

[Chorus]
So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Then I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you
See Niall Horan LiveGet tickets as low as $5You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright

So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth

295,Give Me Your Forever,Episode,Zack Tabudlo,Sad,"Do you remember?
When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel
So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always bе there right by your side
'Causе baby, you're always in my mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 2]
I never knew it would be possible
For you to be with me

Oh, you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh, baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine

Waiting for you, babe

Get out of my sight and leave me behind
Every time you say ""I do""
And I just can't stop all the thoughts that cross my mind
What if I don't give you?
What you're craving for, would you leave me behind?
Life is full of treachery and pain
You're only in for the money, in love with my money
I don't care much for you, get out of my sight
And leave me behind, and leave me behind

I kinda liked a girl I knew

Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder

Snake shit, niggas ain't shit in the game, and I came in like I paid rent
Been the same since the first gen, it's the eighth gen
And they still in the same gym 'cause they can't win
Nigga's lame, and I ain't even try, eight percent
Kicks on fire like Blaziken
This ain't even my main key, but you know I'm going ape again
'Cause this that muthafuckin' guillotine flow
This that fire mixed with muthafuckin' ethylene, ho
This that treat the fucking beat just like I'm Nidoking, bro
Drill that shit to the extreme, but we gon' keep the speed slow
Hol' up

[Verse 13: BlackLynk]
(We are in this entire ho)
Uh, stacking Pokédollars, that's the main mission (Main mission)
Chatter online? Now ya mane missin' (Mane missin')
Pyroar came into this thang spittin' (Thang spittin')
Lion with a little bit of flame with him
I'm snapping like Sharpedo, you'll sleep with the fish
I light the gas, I'm breathing on Weezing and shit
I'm looking hella marine with the team full of drip
The pockets is on Tsareena, the green looking thick
Bitch, I'm dropping 'em flawless
Better look at your options
Hoppip-ing, if for the green, I'll leave your top spinning
Looker post-game, you never know where these opps hidden
Snover, was cold before I became with a bomb with it
Gen 5, I'm the gem that rests in dirt
The fairy that's quick to murk, give just desserts
I'm so fly, might just not address the Surge
I'm running shit like Zigzagoon, Professor Birch
Look at the jewels, Sun and Moon doing a fusion
Bow to the God, Necrozma just finds it amusing
You must've been Faked Out or just hit with Confusion
'Cause you winning? Zorua, a little illusion
If you was hating 'fore I hopped on the map
You can now reserve a spot in the back
I could never fear a team full of rats
Incineroar, I keep that heat on my lap (Bitch)
Keep the blade, you only give light tapers
Kartana, I'll fold a nigga for my paper
Revenue maker that started from the ground like a Flygon
Now the Zard's on a ride pager?
Damn, these rappers clones like Emerald with the cheat codes (Ugh)
Try flipping the bird, you'll lose Peeko
Thought he was tough, like Ursaring with the guts
Now he's gone, and there's still teddy bears on the street pole (Why?)
Bitch

[Verse 14: JWittz]
I'm spittin' fire like a— ah, shit
Do we have Heatmor without a National Dex?
Meanwhile, Masuda sits back, laughing, cashing the checks
Half the fans distracted by these asses and breasts
Their lasses impress, but their graphics lacking in tech
You're like Maractus, nobody asked for this pest
You don't have the badges, man, you lack my respect
You're average at best, Shadow Force, you cannot protect
The only way I'd mimic you is snapping your neck
I rap like I'm possessed, I'm under Alister's hex
My Special Defense massive like I'm packing a vest
Attack with the specs, it's laughable, you cannot affect
You couldn't crack my strategies if you were stacking the deck
Can we stop acting rattled when I'm rapping again?
Like I haven't been bad with a Pal Pad and a pen?
I'm the Zacian, Alpha, you're the Yamper this gen
I'm an Earthquake, nah, fuck it, magnitude ten

[Verse 15: G. Yee]
Nidoking entrance
Retaliate Slaking, I'm back with a Vengeance
And I been overhead, so I kept this
Scheme Black and White, but you brats never Ghetsis
Edgeless rappers, all you Haxorus headless
Life Orb Mesprit, I find that offensive
F spin tracks and the people getting left with
Second hand smoke, that's Ash on CraigsList
And my second hand smoke when the gun aim
Guts spray, boy, I keep the status on my Luxray
Arms straight filthy, Grimer, I leveled up
Make Tubby eat the whole damn clip when that Muk bang
Yeah, leave y'all snacking on trash, I Banette the track
I black body bag it then vanish
The phantom a manual stick shift handles
Bananas took Grookey outta the ignition
Then I pass it to Matt

[Verse 16: Matt Houston]
Yeah, they ask if we with Rocket, nah it's Sobble Gang, y'all can't hang
Feel like God, Arceus on my hip, let the llama bang
When I write the quill lava, I'm back and I got the flames
Hit you like OR/AS, battle me, your brain dropping frames
Run up on your champs ice, catch me snatchin' Wallace chain
Your talent like an Unfeazant fan, boy, not a thing
Want smoke, get what you Jonesin' for, this not a game
The steel deceiving, strays hit you from my wild aim
Check the Hall of Fame, ain't gotta claim I'm the best
Talkin' shit, you Infernape, end up with flame on your head
If you ask ""Who this?"" that's just straight disrespect
Yell, ""Bitch it's Matt Houston,"" and they could say out the rest
We Tornadus, the only true heirs in this bitch
While all you other rappers hoes like Erika clique
I see you buggin', that's Azelea's shit
I'm spittin' fire, killin' so called dragons, got Claire throwing fits
Comparin' to this? Never, this as perfect as it gets
Cubchoo drip, haters so allergic to my wrist
Gentleman flow in 'em verses all in cursive when they writ
Nihilego venom, certain that it merk you when I spit
Got Genesect weapons, want problems? Get steppin'
You been stressin' 'cause y'all all dogshit like Gen 7
Jump on the beat, 6-0, you get killed
Been a beast since day one, fuck your sword and your shield

[Verse 17: CTC]
I got the horses like Terrak, hat is to the back
Country boy, but I'm still Slatt
Back up in the cut, I got Bidoof
If we got an issue keep it simple
My ninjas put that Waterinium right to your Tympole
And if you isn't Slime nor Slatt, you goin' Sligoo (Slatt, slatt)
What I'm 'boutta do, oh boy, I wouldn't wish you
Remoraid your place, .223 the brand new issue
Karrablast's the type that'll never ever miss you
Turn your ass to Ash and make your mama miss you
(She gon' miss you, dawg, sheesh, sheesh)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ridin' 'round town doin' bad shit
Officer Jenny pulled up, she lookin' ratchet
Klang by my side, clingy but she get to clackin'
Bitch mob, yeah, the task force, that bitch ain't tacit, yee yee
Focus Blast hit like death and taxes
Steph's dad's Twineedles just ain't half as accurate, brrt-brrt
They gettin' dropped like bags at Saks Fifth
Reachin' in her bag for Max Revive, it wasn't happenin'
Worry 'bout who gettin' sacked sixth
After I bagged her whole team, okay, you know I had to bag it
No cappin', they got it backwards tryna catch 'em
Let my butter free, when my Metapod hit level ten, I press B, I'm a savage
Hop up on the S.S. Anne with some Mexicans
That got no SSN and I'm the motherfucking captain
And it's fuck ICE, this the new Enter the Dragon
See this Red R on my leather 'Preme jacket
And my belt got more G's than your faction
Watch how a G move, don't need Gigantamaxin'
Rapidash stay in the back, he's bashful
With a tack still attached, a saddle and a satchel
What's a horse to a dinosaur, killa? Aerodactyl
Terrak knock the air out out that bitch, T wrecked a dactyl
No cap, always factual
IDM forever after

[Bridge: VI Seconds and Shofu]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Aw shit)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(You niggas ain't ready)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Said these niggas ain't ready)
Lord (Talk to 'em, bitch, come on)

[Verse 18: VI Seconds, Shofu & Both]
The Gawd is back, I'm lookin' at you peons from the stairs
The stones fire, bitch I been through eons with the flare
You know the vibes ""dot dot dot,"" Red could never rival that
Got HM01, now my pockets Gigantamax
These niggas askin' where the battles at (Huh?), I'ma handle that
Shit ain't adding up, and you don't wanna see the aftermath
You niggas couldn't see me like I Sand Attacked
Been the same, you niggas always switching up something like you Ash's hat
Giovanni, mob ties, ain't a sound when you drop
Meowth, Persian, you pussies get a round at your top
You in a Bind, now you bound 'til I stop
Put a pin to your puff, meanin' metal to your round 'til it pop
Ain't askin' a lot, it's nothin' to attack for the guap
Bitch, I keep that Draco on me and my stats never drop
I ran with the mop, ain't battle for these badges I copped
Everybody 31, won't find no trash in the box
On the throne, think you fuckin' with the champ, you delirious
Get your top spun like Ash gettin' serious
I'm lit, the dazzling gleam make you all see me
The Iced Fangs got more flavors than Alcremie
We stay strapped, got more pieces than Victini
Ain't nobody hyper, I promise the wrist beamin'
You ain't beating me, tell them niggas to keep dreamin'
Bewear in the anime, how I just keep squeezing
The drip nasty like Muk movin', your shorty like to Swalot
Told her this Bone Club for her consumin'
Mimikyu? You steady mimicking the face
Waste my time and space, they'll find your spirit in a lake
Fuck Galar, boy, we coming for your head region
One of us gon' die if we ending up dead even
Nigga when that dot on your head, that ain't Red speakin'
It ain't Farfetch'd when the stick leave your head leakin'
Sirfetch'd, bigger stick, out for any niggas schemin'
Chandelure, fire on you and I'll hang you from the ceiling
Couldn't see me with a Silph Scope, actin' off the shits bro
The long nose keepin' you controlled like Hypno
I keep it on me, let me show you what it hit for
Pokedollars, bitch you know the line, I really flip those
Tiptoe, 6-0, nigga I ain't vibin' with ya tempo
I pass along your life as a memento
You a king? Tryna fuck with the kid? You get a shit show
Pokéstar Studios, we gon' let a clip go
We dog niggas, goin' 'round your neck with your leash
Ten years in the game, come correct if you speak
More O's in my account than a Gen 1 bike price
You new to my region, lemme show you what my life like
The elite, there's no debatin' that we nicer
If you buggin', dump the metal, now you change like a Scyther
Could give a fuck about your line up, all of you get lined up
Dialga on my wrist, still saying that your time's up
Made it through Unova, now we ball in any weather
'Cause there ain't a team that could make a cypher any better5Embed"

Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Until it's time)
This love will keep through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Oh)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh, it's 'til it's time we die)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

To know that you'll leave

Only hold till your coffee warms

Once a time, put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched clicking heels

403,Supermarket Flowers,÷ (Deluxe),Ed Sheeran,Sad,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Or they would try, they would try

411,Don't Watch Me Cry,Lost & Found,Jorja Smith,Sad,"Oh, it hurts the most 'cause I don't know the cause
Maybe I shouldn't have cried when you left and told me not to wait
Oh, it kills the most to say that I still care
Now I'm left tryna rewind the times you held and kissed me there

[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder if you're thinking ""Is she alright all alone?""
I wonder if you tried to call, but couldn't find your phone
Have I ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine?
A moment in time, don't watch me cry
A moment in time, don't watch me cry

[Chorus]
I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
I'm just crying 'cause I can't escape what could've been
Are you aware when you set me free?
All I can do is let my heart bleed

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's harder when you can't see through their thoughts
Not that I wanna get in, but I want to see how your mind works
No, it's harder when they don't know what they've done
Thinking it's best that they leave, meaning that I'll have to move on

412,Not About Angels,Not About Angels,Birdy,Sad,"We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

[Chorus]
'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go and make us special, oh
Don't give me up, don't give me up

[Verse 2]
How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd search the whole wide world, world
Would you dare to let it go?

[Chorus]
'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go and make us special, oh oh
Don't give me up, don't give me up

413,Writer In The Dark,Melodrama,Lorde,Sad,"Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I’ve stopped needing you

414,I'll Never Love Again - Extended Version,A Star Is Born Soundtrack,Lady Gaga,Sad,"Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone

And I'm not movin' on

416,The Only Exception,Brand New Eyes,Paramore,Sad,"When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

                                DINNERS AT RIVEBELLE — ENTER ALBERTINE

   That day, as for some days past, Saint-Loup had been obliged to go to Doncières, where, until his leave finally expired, he would be on duty now until late every afternoon. I was sorry that he was not at Balbec. I had seen alight from carriages and pass, some into the ball-room of the Casino, others into the ice-cream shop, young women who at a distance had seemed to me lovely. I was passing through one of those periods of our youth, unprovided with any one definite love, vacant, in which at all times and in all places — as a lover the woman by whose charms he is smitten — we desire, we seek, we see Beauty. Let but a single real feature — the little that one distinguishes of a woman seen from afar or from behind — enable us to project the form of beauty before our eyes, we imagine that we have seen her before, our heart beats, we hasten in pursuit, and will always remain half-persuaded that it was she, provided that the woman has vanished: it is only if we manage to overtake her that we realise our mistake

   Besides, as I grew more and more delicate, I was inclined to overrate the simplest pleasures because of the difficulties that sprang up in the way of my attaining them. Charming women I seemed to see all round me, because I was too tired, if it was on the beach, too shy if it was in the Casino or at a pastry-cook’s, to go anywhere near them. And yet if I was soon to die I should have liked first to know the appearance at close quarters, in reality of the prettiest girls that life had to offer, even although it should be another than myself or no one at all who was to take advantage of the offer. (I did not, in fact, appreciate the desire for possession that underlay my curiosity.) I should have had the courage to enter the ballroom if Saint-Loup had been with me. Left by myself, I was simply hanging about in front of the Grand Hotel until it was time for me to join my grandmother, when, still almost at the far end of the paved ‘front’ along which they projected in a discordant spot of colour, I saw coming towards me five or six young girls, as different in appearance and manner from all the people whom one was accustomed to see at Balbec as could have been, landed there none knew whence, a flight of gulls which performed with measured steps upon the sands — the dawdlers using their wings to overtake the rest — a movement the purpose of which seems as obscure to the human bathers, whom they do not appear to see, as it is clearly determined in their own birdish minds

   One of these strangers was pushing as she came, with one hand, her bicycle; two others carried golf-clubs; and their attire generally was in contrast to that of the other girls at Balbec, some of whom, it was true, went in for games, but without adopting any special outfit

   It was the hour at which ladies and gentlemen came out every day for a turn on the ‘front,’ exposed to the merciless fire of the long glasses fastened upon them, as if they had each borne some disfigurement which she felt it her duty to inspect in its minutest details, by the chief magistrate’s wife, proudly seated there with her back to the band-stand, in the middle of that dread line of chairs on which presently they too, actors turned critics, would come and establish themselves, to scrutinise in their turn those others who would then be filing past them. All these people who paced up and down the ‘front,’ tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it be thought that they were not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love — and consequently their fear — of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men, whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to shew them that they despise them. In the case of the solitary, his seclusion, even when it is absolute and ends only with life itself, has often as its primary cause a disordered love of the crowd, which so far overrules every other feeling that, not being able to win, when he goes out, the admiration of his hall-porter, of the passers-by, of the cabman whom he hails, he prefers not to be seen by them at all, and with that object abandons every activity that would oblige him to go out of doors

   Among all these people, some of whom were pursuing a train of thought, but if so betrayed its instability by spasmodic gestures, a roving gaze as little in keeping as the circumspect titubation of their neighbours, the girls whom I had noticed, with that mastery over their limbs which comes from perfect bodily condition and a sincere contempt for the rest of humanity, were advancing straight ahead, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the movements that they wished to perform, each of their members in full independence of all the rest, the greater part of their bodies preserving that immobility which is so noticeable in a good waltzer. They were now quite near me. Although each was a type absolutely different from the others, they all had beauty; but to tell the truth I had seen them for so short a time, and without venturing to look them straight in the face, that I had not yet individualised any of them. Save one, whom her straight nose, her dark complexion pointed in contrast among the rest, like (in a renaissance picture of the Epiphany) a king of Arab cast, they were known to me only, one by a pair of eyes, hard, set and mocking; another by cheeks in which the pink had that coppery tint which makes one think of geraniums; and even of these points I had not yet indissolubly attached any one to one of these girls rather than to another; and when (according to the order in which their series met the eye, marvellous because the most different aspects came next one another, because all scales of colours were combined in it, but confused as a piece of music in which I should not have been able to isolate and identify at the moment of their passage the successive phrases, no sooner distinguished than forgotten) I saw emerge a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, I knew not if these were the same that had already charmed me a moment ago, I could not bring them home to any one girl whom I might thereby have set apart from the rest and so identified. And this want, in my vision, of the demarcations which I should presently establish between them sent flooding over the group a wave of harmony, the continuous transfusion of a beauty fluid, collective and mobile

   It was not perhaps, in this life of ours, mere chance that had, in forming this group of friends, chosen them all of such beauty; perhaps these girls (whose attitude was enough to reveal their nature, bold, frivolous and hard), extremely sensitive to everything that was ludicrous or ugly, incapable of yielding to an intellectual or moral attraction, had naturally felt themselves, among companions of their own age, repelled by all those in whom a pensive or sensitive disposition was betrayed by shyness, awkwardness, constraint, by what, they would say,‘didn’t appeal’ to them, and from such had held aloof; while they attached themselves, on the other hand, to others to whom they were drawn by a certain blend of grace, suppleness, and physical neatness, the only form in which they were able to picture the frankness of a seductive character and the promise of pleasant hours in one another’s company. Perhaps, too, the class to which they belonged, a class which I should not have found it easy to define, was at that point in its evolution at which, whether thanks to its growing wealth and leisure, or thanks to new athletic habits, extended now even to certain plebeian elements, and a habit of physical culture to which had not yet been added the culture of the mind, a social atmosphere, comparable to that of smooth and prolific schools of sculpture, which have not yet gone in for tortured expressions, produces naturally and in abundance fine bodies with fine legs, fine hips, wholesome and reposeful faces, with an air of agility and guile. And were they not noble and calm models of human beauty that I beheld there, outlined against the sea, like statues exposed to the sunlight upon a Grecian shore?

   Just as if, in the heart of their band, which progressed along the ‘front’ like a luminous comet, they had decided that the surrounding crowd was composed of creatures of another race whose sufferings even could not awaken in them any sense of fellowship, they appeared not to see them, forced those who had stopped to talk to step aside, as though from the path of a machine that had been set going by itself, so that it was no good waiting for it to get out of their way, their utmost sign of consciousness being when, if some old gentleman of whom they did not admit the existence and thrust from them the contact, had fled with a frightened or furious, but a headlong or ludicrous motion, they looked at one another and smiled. They had, for whatever did not form part of their group, no affectation of contempt; their genuine contempt was sufficient. But they could not set eyes on an obstacle without amusing themselves by crossing it, either in a running jump or with both feet together, because they were all filled to the brim, exuberant with that youth which we need so urgently to spend that even when we are unhappy or unwell, obedient rather to the necessities of our age than to the mood of the day, we can never pass anything that can be jumped over or slid down without indulging ourselves conscientiously, interrupting, interspersing our slow progress — as Chopin his most melancholy phrase — with graceful deviations in which caprice is blended with virtuosity. The wife of an elderly banker, after hesitating between various possible exposures for her husband, had settled him on a folding chair, facing the ‘front,’ sheltered from wind and sun by the band-stand. Having seen him comfortably installed there, she had gone to buy a newspaper which she would read aloud to him, to distract him — one of her little absences which she never prolonged for more than five minutes, which seemed long enough to him but which she repeated at frequent intervals so that this old husband on whom she lavished an attention that she took care to conceal, should have the impression that he was still quite alive and like other people and was in no need of protection. The platform of the band-stand provided, above his head, a natural and tempting springboard, across which, without a moment’s hesitation, the eldest of the little band began to run; she jumped over the terrified old man, whose yachting cap was brushed by the nimble feet, to the great delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a ‘dashing’ face, which expressed, for that bold act, an admiration and a merriment in which I seemed to discern a trace of timidity, a shamefaced and blustering timidity which did not exist in the others. “Oh, the poor old man; he makes me sick; he looks half dead;” said a girl with a croaking voice, but with more sarcasm than sympathy. They walked on a little way, then stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, with no thought whether they were impeding the passage of other people, and held a council, a solid body of irregular shape, compact, unusual and shrill, like birds that gather on the ground at the moment of flight; then they resumed their leisurely stroll along the ‘front,’ against a background of sea

   By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken’s beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape (which gave her so poverty-stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self-esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the ‘front’ dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest); a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo-cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating ‘live my own life’) that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend’s hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing-tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight — in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks — I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian

   Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self-sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a ‘band apart’ established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound

   For an instant, as I passed the dark one with the fat cheeks who was wheeling a bicycle, I caught her smiling, sidelong glance, aimed from the centre of that inhuman world which enclosed the life of this little tribe, an inaccessible, unknown world to which the idea of what I was could certainly never attain nor find a place in it. Wholly occupied with what her companions were saying, this young girl in her polo-cap, pulled down very low over her brow, had she seen me at the moment in which the dark ray emanating from her eyes had fallen on me? In the heart of what universe did she distinguish me? It would have been as hard for me to say as, when certain peculiarities are made visible, thanks to the telescope, in a neighbouring planet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that human beings inhabit it, that they can see us, or to say what ideas the sight of us can have aroused in their minds

   If we thought that the eyes of a girl like that were merely two glittering sequins of mica, we should not be athirst to know her and to unite her life to ours. But we feel that what shines in those reflecting discs is not due solely to their material composition; that it is, unknown to us, the dark shadows of the ideas that the creature is conceiving, relative to the people and places that she knows — the turf of racecourses, the sand of cycling tracks over which, pedalling on past fields and woods, she would have drawn me after her, that little peri, more seductive to me than she of the Persian paradise — the shadows, too, of the home to which she will presently return, of the plans that she is forming or that others have formed for her; and above all that it is she, with her desires, her sympathies, her revulsions, her obscure and incessant will. I knew that I should never possess this young cyclist if I did not possess also what there was in her eyes. And it was consequently her whole life that filled me with desire; a sorrowful desire because I felt that it was not to be realised, but exhilarating, because what had hitherto been my life, having ceased of a sudden to be my whole life, being no more now than a little part of the space stretching out before me, which I was burning to cover and which was composed of the lives of these girls, offered me that prolongation, that possible multiplication of oneself which is happiness. And no doubt the fact that we had, these girls and I, not one habit — as we had not one idea — in common, was to make it more difficult for me to make friends with them and to please them. But perhaps, also, it was thanks to those differences, to my consciousness that there did not enter into the composition of the nature and actions of these girls a single element that I knew or possessed, that there came in place of my satiety a thirst — like that with which a dry land burns — for a life which my soul, because it had never until now received one drop of it, would absorb all the more greedily in long draughts, with a more perfect imbibition
   I had looked so closely at the dark cyclist with the bright eyes that she seemed to notice my attention, and said to the biggest of the girls something that I could not hear. To be honest, this dark one was not the one that pleased me most, simply because she was dark and because (since the day on which, from the little path by Tansonville, I had seen Gilberte) a girl with reddish hair and a golden skin had remained for me the inaccessible ideal. But Gilberte herself, had I not loved her principally because she had appeared to me haloed with that aureole of being the friend of Bergotte, of going with him to look at old cathedrals? And in the same way could I not rejoice at having seen this dark girl look at me (which made me hope that it would be easier for me to get to know her first), for she would introduce me to the others, to the pitiless one who had jumped over the old man’s head, to the cruel one who had said “He makes me sick, poor old man!”— to all of them in turn, among whom, moreover, she had the distinction of being their inseparable companion? And yet the supposition that I might some day be the friend of one or other of these girls, that their eyes, whose incomprehensible gaze struck me now and again, playing upon me unawares, like the play of sunlight upon a wall, might ever, by a miraculous alchemy, allow to interpenetrate among their ineffable particles the idea of my existence, some affection for my person, that I myself might some day take my place among them in the evolution of their course by the sea’s edge — that supposition appeared to me to contain within it a contradiction as insoluble as if, standing before some classical frieze or a fresco representing a procession, I had believed it possible for me, the spectator, to take my place, beloved of them, among the godlike hierophants

   The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range

   There must be, between us and the fish which, if we saw it for the first time cooked and served on a table, would not appear worth the endless trouble, craft and stratagem that are necessary if we are to catch it, interposed, during our afternoons with the rod, the ripple to whose surface come wavering, without our quite knowing what we intend to do with them, the burnished gleam of flesh, the indefiniteness of a form, in the fluidity of a transparent and flowing azure

   These girls benefited also by that alteration of social values characteristic of seaside life. All the advantages which, in our ordinary environment, extend and magnify our importance, we there find to have become invisible, in fact to be eliminated; while on the other hand the people whom we suppose, without reason, to enjoy similar advantages appear to us amplified to artificial dimensions. This made it easy for strange women generally, and to-day for these girls in particular, to acquire an enormous importance in my eyes, and impossible to make them aware of such importance as I might myself possess

   But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a ‘proof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure — as Swann had always refused to do before Odette’s day — from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature — which if it applied to these girls would apply to all — and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist’s satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering

   I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also

   However, there was no need, when one went indoors, to leave the ‘front’ and to enter the hotel by the hall, that is to say from behind. By virtue of an alteration of the clock which reminded me of those Saturdays when, at Combray, we used to have luncheon an hour earlier, now with summer at the full the days had become so long that the sun was still high in the heavens, as though it were only tea-time, when the tables were being laid for dinner in the Grand Hotel. And so the great sliding windows were kept open from the ground. I had but to step across a low wooden sill to find myself in the dining-room, through which I walked and straight across to the lift

   As I passed the office I addressed a smile to the manager, and with no shudder of disgust gathered one for myself from his face which, since I had been at Balbec, my comprehensive study of it was injecting and transforming, little by little, like a natural history preparation. His features had become familiar to me, charged with a meaning that was of no importance but still intelligible, like a script which one can read, and had ceased in any way to resemble these queer, intolerable characters which his face had presented to me on that first day, when I had seen before me a personage now forgotten, or, if I succeeded in recalling him, unrecognisable, difficult to identify with this insignificant and polite personality of which the other was but a caricature, a hideous and rapid sketch. Without either the shyness or the sadness of the evening of my arrival I rang for the attendant, who no longer stood in silence while I rose by his side in the lift as in a mobile thoracic cage propelled upwards along its ascending pillar, but repeated:

    “There aren’t the people now there were a month back. They’re beginning to go now; the days are drawing in.” He said this not because there was any truth in it but because, having an engagement, presently, for a warmer part of the coast, he would have liked us all to leave, so that the hotel could be shut up and he have a few days to himself before ‘rejoining’ in his new place. ‘Rejoin’ and ‘new’ were not, by the way, incompatible terms, since, for the lift-boy,‘rejoin’ was the usual form of the verb ‘to join.’ The only thing that surprised me was that he condescended to say ‘place,’ for he belonged to that modern proletariat which seeks to efface from our language every trace of the rule of domesticity. A moment later, however, he informed me that in the ‘situation’ which he was about to ‘rejoin,’ he would have a smarter ‘tunic’ and a better ‘salary,’ the words ‘livery’ and ‘wages’ sounding to him obsolete and unseemly. And as, by an absurd contradiction, the vocabulary has, through thick and thin, among us ‘masters,’ survived the conception of inequality, I was always failing to understand what the lift-boy said. For instance, the only thing that interested me was to know whether my grandmother was in the hotel. Now, forestalling my questions, the lift-boy would say to me: “That lady has just gone out from your rooms.” I was invariably taken in; I supposed that he meant my grandmother. “No, that lady; I think she’s an employee of yours.” As in the old speech of the middle classes, which ought really to be done away with, a cook is not called an employee, I thought for a moment: “But he must be mistaken. We don’t own a factory; we haven’t any employees.” Suddenly I remembered that the title of ‘employee’ is, like the wearing of a moustache among waiters, a sop to their self-esteem given to servants, and realised that this lady who had just gone out must be Françoise (probably on a visit to the coffee-maker, or to watch the Belgian lady’s little maid at her sewing), though even this sop did not satisfy the lift-boy, for he would say quite naturally, speaking pityingly of his own class, ‘with the working man’ or ‘the small person,’ using the same singular form as Racine when he speaks of ‘the poor.’ But as a rule, for my zeal and timidity of the first evening were now things of the past, I no longer spoke to the lift-boy. It was he now who stood there and received no answer during the short journey on which he threaded his way through the hotel, hollowed out inside like a toy, which extended round about us, floor by floor, the ramifications of its corridors in the depths of which the light grew velvety, lost its tone, diminished the communicating doors, the steps of the service stairs which it transformed into that amber haze, unsubstantial and mysterious as a twilight, in which Rembrandt picks out here and there a window-sill or a well-head. And on each landing a golden light reflected from the carpet indicated the setting sun and the lavatory window

   I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the ‘front’: “She is a friend of the little Simonet girl” with that self-important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: “He is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld.” And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was ‘a friend of the little Simonet.’ A privilege, obviously, that did not appear to be granted to all the world. For aristocracy is a relative state. And there are plenty of inexpensive little holes and corners where the son of an upholsterer is the arbiter of fashion and reigns over a court like any young Prince of Wales. I have often since then sought to recall how it first sounded for me there on the beach, that name of Simonet, still quite indefinite as to its form, which I had failed to distinguish, and also as to its significance, to the designation by it of such and such a person, or perhaps of some one else; imprinted, in fact, with that vagueness, that novelty which we find so moving in the sequel, when the name whose letters are every moment engraved more deeply on our hearts by our incessant thought of them has become (though this was not to happen to me with the name of the ‘little Simonet’ until several years had passed) the first coherent sound that comes to our lips, whether on waking from sleep or on recovering from a swoon, even before the idea of what o’clock it is or of where we are, almost before the word ‘I,’ as though the person whom it names were more ‘we’ even than we ourselves, and as though after a brief spell of unconsciousness the phase that is the first of all to dissolve is that in which we were not thinking of her. I do not know why I said to myself from the first that the name Simonet must be that of one of the band of girls; from that moment I never ceased to ask myself how I could get to know the Simonet family, get to know them, moreover, through people whom they considered superior to themselves (which ought not to be difficult if the girls were only common little ‘bounders’) so that they might not form a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have a perfect knowledge, one cannot effect the complete absorption of a person who disdains one, so long as one has not overcome her disdain. And since, whenever the idea of women who are so different from us penetrates our senses, unless we are able to forget it or the competition of other ideas eliminates it, we know no rest until we have converted those aliens into something that is compatible with ourself, our heart being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot abide the infusion of any foreign body into its veins without at once striving to digest and assimilate it: the little Simonet must be the prettiest of them all — she who, I felt moreover, might yet become my mistress, for she was the only one who, two or three times half-turning her head, had appeared to take cognisance of my fixed stare. I asked the lift-boy whether he knew of any people at Balbec called Simonet. Not liking to admit that there was anything which he did not know, he replied that he seemed to have heard the name somewhere. As we reached the highest landing I told him to have the latest lists of visitors sent up to me

   I stepped out of the lift, but instead of going to my room I made my way farther along the corridor, for before my arrival the valet in charge of the landing, despite his horror of draughts, had opened the window at the end, which instead of looking out to the sea faced the hill and valley inland, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, which were made of clouded glass, were generally closed. I made a short ‘station’ in front of it, time enough just to pay my devotions to the view which for once it revealed over the hill against which the back of the hotel rested, a view that contained but a solitary house, planted in the middle distance, though the perspective and the evening light in which I saw it, while preserving its mass, gave it a sculptural beauty and a velvet background, as though to one of those architectural works in miniature, tiny temples or chapels wrought in gold and enamels, which serve as reliquaries and are exposed only on rare and solemn days for the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet, who carried in one hand a bunch of keys and with the other saluted me by touching his verger’s skull-cap, though without raising it, on account of the pure, cool evening air, came and drew together, like those of a shrine, the two sides of the window, and so shut off the minute edifice, the glistening relic from my adoring gaze. I went into my room. Regularly, as the season advanced, the picture that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass which it distended with the curve of its round waves, the sea, set among the iron uprights of my window like a piece of stained glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of the bay little plumed triangles of an unmoving spray delineated with the delicacy of a feather or a downy breast from Pisanello’s pencil, and fixed in that white, unalterable, creamy enamel which is used to depict fallen snow in Gallé‘s glass

   Presently the days grew shorter and at the moment when I entered my room the violet sky seemed branded with the stiff, geometrical, travelling, effulgent figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition) leaning over the sea from the hinge of the horizon as a sacred picture leans over a high altar, while the different parts of the western sky exposed in the glass fronts of the low mahogany bookcases that ran along the walls, which I carried back in my mind to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, seemed like those different scenes which some old master executed long ago for a. confraternity upon a shrine, whose separate panels are now exhibited side by side upon the wall of a museum gallery, so that the visitor’s imagination alone can restore them to their place on the predella of the reredos. A few weeks later, when I went upstairs, the sun had already set. Like the one that I used to see at Combray, behind the Calvary, when I was coming home from a walk and looking forward to going down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky over the sea, compact and clear-cut as a layer of aspic over meat, then, a little later, over a sea already cold and blue like a grey mullet, a sky of the same pink as the salmon that we should presently be ordering at Rivebelle reawakened the pleasure which I was to derive from the act of dressing to go out to dinner. Over the sea, quite near the shore, were trying to rise, one beyond another, at wider and wider intervals, vapours of a pitchy blackness but also of the polish and consistency of agate, of a visible weight, so much so that the highest among them, poised at the end of their contorted stem and overreaching the centre of gravity of the pile that had hitherto supported them, seemed on the point of bringing down in ruin this lofty structure already half the height of the sky, and of precipitating it into the sea. The sight of a ship that was moving away like a nocturnal traveller gave me the same impression that I had had in the train of being set free from the necessity of sleep and from confinement in a bedroom. Not that I felt myself a prisoner in the room in which I now was, since in another hour I should have left it and be getting into the carriage. I threw myself down on the bed; and, just as if I had been lying in a berth on board one of those steamers which I could see quite near to me and which, when night came, it would be strange to see stealing slowly out into the darkness, like shadowy and silent but unsleeping swans, I was on all sides surrounded by pictures of the sea

   But as often as not they were, indeed, only pictures; I forgot that below their coloured expanse was hollowed the sad desolation of the beach, travelled by the restless evening breeze whose breath I had so anxiously felt on my arrival at Balbec; besides, even in my room, being wholly taken up with thoughts of the girls whom I had seen go past, I was no longer in a state of mind calm or disinterested enough to allow the formation of any really deep impression of beauty. The anticipation of dinner at Rivebelle made my mood more frivolous still, and my mind, dwelling at such moments upon the surface of the body which I was going to dress up so as to try to appear as pleasing as possible in the feminine eyes which would be scrutinising me in the brilliantly lighted restaurant, was incapable of putting any depth behind the colour of things. And if, beneath my window, the unwearying, gentle flight of sea-martins and swallows had not arisen like a playing fountain, like living fireworks, joining the intervals between their soaring rockets with the motionless white streaming lines of long horizontal wakes of foam, without the charming miracle of this natural and local phenomenon, which brought into touch with reality the scenes that I had before my eyes, I might easily have believed that they were no more than a selection, made afresh every day, of paintings which were shewn quite arbitrarily in the place in which I happened to be and without having any necessary connexion with that place. At one time it was an exhibition of Japanese colour-prints: beside the neat disc of sun, red and round as the moon, a yellow cloud seemed a lake against which black swords were outlined like the trees upon its shore; a bar of a tender pink which I had never seen again after my first paint-box swelled out into a river on either bank of which boats seemed to be waiting high and dry for some one to push them down and set them afloat. And with the contemptuous, bored, frivolous glance of an amateur or a woman hurrying through a picture gallery between two social engagements, I would say to myself: “Curious sunset, this; it’s different from what they usually are but after all I’ve seen them just as fine, just as remarkable as this.” I had more pleasure on evenings when a ship, absorbed and liquefied by the horizon so much the same in colour as herself (an Impressionist exhibition this time) that it seemed to be also of the same matter, appeared as if some one had simply cut out with a pair of scissors her bows and the rigging in which she tapered into a slender filigree from the vaporous blue of the sky. Sometimes the ocean filled almost the whole of my window, when it was enlarged and prolonged by a band of sky edged at the top only by a line that was of the same blue as the sea, so that I supposed it all to be still sea, and the change in colour due only to some effect of light and shade. Another day the sea was painted only in the lower part of the window, all the rest of which was so filled with innumerable clouds, packed one against another in horizontal bands, that its panes seemed to be intended, for some special purpose or to illustrate a special talent of the artist, to present a ‘Cloud Study,’ while the fronts of the various bookcases shewing similar clouds but in another part of the horizon and differently coloured by the light, appeared to be offering as it were the repetition — of which certain of our contemporaries are so fond — of one and the same effect always observed at different hours but able now in the immobility of art to be seen all together in a single room, drawn in pastel and mounted under glass. And sometimes to a sky and sea uniformly grey a rosy touch would be added with an exquisite delicacy, while a little butterfly that had gone to sleep at the foot of the window seemed to be attaching with its wings at the corner of this ‘Harmony in Grey and Pink’ in the Whistler manner the favourite signature of the Chelsea master. The pink vanished; there was nothing now left to look at. I rose for a moment and before lying down again drew dose the inner curtains. Above them I could see from my bed the ray of light that still remained, growing steadily fainter and thinner, but it was without any feeling of sadness, without any regret for its passing that I thus allowed to die above the curtains the hour at which, as a rule, I was seated at table, for I knew that this day was of another kind than ordinary days, longer, like those arctic days which night interrupts for a few minutes only; I knew that from the chrysalis of the dusk was preparing to emerge, by a radiant metamorphosis, the dazzling light of the Rivebelle restaurant. I said to myself: “It is time”; I stretched myself on the bed, and rose, and finished dressing; and I found a charm in these idle moments, lightened of every material burden, in which while down below the others were dining I was employing the forces accumulated during the inactivity of this last hour of the day only in drying my washed body, in putting on a dinner jacket, in tying my tie, in making all those gestures which were already dictated by the anticipated pleasure of seeing again some woman whom I had noticed, last time, at Rivebelle, who had seemed to be watching me, had perhaps left the table for a moment only in the hope that I would follow her; it was with joy that I enriched myself with all these attractions so as to give myself, whole, alert, willing, to a new life, free, without cares, in which I would lean my hesitations upon the calm strength of Saint-Loup, and would choose from among the different species of animated nature and the produce of every land those which, composing the unfamiliar dishes that my companion would at once order, might have tempted my appetite or my imagination. And then at the end of the season came the days when I could no longer pass indoors from the ‘front’ through the dining-room; its windows stood open no more, for it was night now outside and the swarm of poor folk and curious idlers, attracted by the blaze of light which they might not reach, hung in black clusters chilled by the north wind to the luminous sliding walls of that buzzing hive of glass
   There was a knock at my door; it was Aimé who had come upstairs in person with the latest lists of visitors

   Aimé could not go away without telling me that Dreyfus was guilty a thousand times over. “It will all come out,” he assured me, “not this year, but next. It was a gentleman who’s very thick with the General Staff, told me. I asked him if they wouldn’t decide to bring it all to light at once, before the year is out. He laid down his cigarette,” Aimé went on, acting the scene for my benefit, and, shaking his head and his forefinger as his informant had done, as much as to say: “We mustn’t expect too much!”—”‘Not this year, Aimé,’ those were his very words, putting his hand on my shoulder, ‘It isn’t possible. But next Easter, yes!’” And Aimé tapped me gently on my shoulder, saying, “You see, I’m letting you have it exactly as he told me,” whether because he was flattered at this act of familiarity by a distinguished person or so that I might better appreciate, with a full knowledge of the facts, the worth of the arguments and our grounds for hope

   It was not without a slight throb of the heart that on the first page of the list I caught sight of the words ‘Simonet and family.’ I had in me a store of old dream-memories which dated from my childhood, and in which all the tenderness (tenderness that existed in my heart, but, when my heart felt it, was not distinguishable from anything else) was wafted to me by a person as different as possible from myself. This person, once again I fashioned her, utilising for the purpose the name Simonet and the memory of the harmony that had reigned between the young bodies which I had seen displaying themselves on the beach, in a sportive procession worthy of Greek art or of Giotto. I knew not which of these girls was Mlle. Simonet, if indeed any of them were so named, but I did know that I was loved by Mlle. Simonet and that I was going, with Saint-Loup’s help, to attempt to know her. Unfortunately, having on that condition only obtained an extension of his leave, he was obliged to report for duty every day at Doncières: but to make him forsake his military duty I had felt that I might count, more even than on his friendship for myself, on that same curiosity, as a human naturalist, which I myself had so often felt — even without having seen the person mentioned, and simply on hearing some one say that there was a pretty cashier at a fruiterer’s — to acquaint myself with a new variety of feminine beauty. But that curiosity I had been wrong in hoping to excite in Saint-Loup by speaking to him of my band of girls. For it had been and would long remain paralysed in him by his love for that actress whose lover he was. And even if he had felt it lightly stirring him he would have repressed it, from an almost superstitious belief that on his own fidelity might depend that of his mistress. And so it was without any promise from him that he would take an active interest in my girls that we started out to dine at Rivebelle

   At first, when we arrived there, the sun used just to have set, but it was light still; in the garden outside the restaurant, where the lamps had not yet been lighted, the heat of the day fell and settled, as though in a vase along the sides of which the transparent, dusky jelly of the air seemed of such consistency that a tall rose-tree fastened against the dim wall which it streaked with pink veins, looked like the arborescence that one sees at the heart of an onyx. Presently night had always fallen when we left the carriage, often indeed before we started from Balbec if the evening was wet and we had put off sending for the carriage in the hope of the weather’s improving. But on those days it was without any sadness that I listened to the wind howling, I knew that it did not mean the abandonment of my plans, imprisonment in my bedroom; I knew that in the great dining-room of the restaurant, which we would enter to the sound of the music of the gypsy band, the innumerable lamps would triumph easily over darkness and chill, by applying to them their broad cauteries of molten gold, and I jumped light-heartedly after Saint-Loup into the closed carriage which stood waiting for us in the rain. For some time past the words of Bergotte, when he pronounced himself positive that, in spite of all I might say, I had been created to enjoy, pre-eminently, the pleasures of the mind, had restored to me, with regard to what I might succeed in achieving later on, a hope that was disappointed afresh every day by the boredom that I felt on setting myself down before a writing-table to start work on a critical essay or a novel. “After all,” I said to myself, “possibly the pleasure that its author has found in writing it is not the infallible test of the literary value of a page; it may be only an accessory, one that is often to be found superadded to that value, but the want of which can have no prejudicial effect on it. Perhaps some of the greatest masterpieces were written yawning.” My grandmother set my doubts at rest by telling me that I should be able to work and should enjoy working as soon as my health improved. And, our doctor having thought it only prudent to warn me of the grave risks to which my state of health might expose me, and having outlined all the hygienic precaution that I ought to take to avoid any accident — I subordinated all my pleasures to an object which I judged to be infinitely more important than them, that of becoming strong enough to be able to bring into being the work which I had, possibly, within me; I had been exercising over myself, ever since I had come to Balbec, a scrupulous and constant control. Nothing would have induced me, there, to touch the cup of coffee which would have robbed me of the night’s sleep that was necessary if I was not to be tired next day. But as soon as we reached Rivebelle, immediately, what with the excitement of a new pleasure, and finding myself in that different zone into which the exception to our rule of life takes us after it has cut the thread, patiently spun throughout so many days, that was guiding us towards wisdom — as though there were never to be any such thing as to-morrow, nor any lofty aims to be realised, vanished all that exact machinery of prudent hygienic measures which had been working to safeguard them. A waiter was offering to take my coat, whereupon Saint-Loup asked: “You’re sure you won’t be cold? Perhaps you’d better keep it: it’s not very warm in here.”

    “No, no,” I assured him; and perhaps I did not feel the cold; but however that might be, I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the necessity of not dying, the importance of work. I gave up my coat; we entered the dining-room to the sound of some warlike march played by the gipsies, we advanced between two rows of tables laid for dinner as along an easy path of glory, and, feeling a happy glow imparted to our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which rendered us its military honours, gave us this unmerited triumph, we concealed it beneath a grave and frozen mien, beneath a languid, casual gait, so as not to be like those music-hall ‘mashers’ who, having wedded a ribald verse to a patriotic air, come running on to the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general

   From that moment I was a new man, who was no longer my grandmother’s grandson and would remember her only when it was time to get up and go, but the brother, for the time being, of the waiters who were going to bring us our dinner

   The dose of beer — all the more, that of champagne — which at Balbec I should not have ventured to take in a week, albeit to my calm and lucid consciousness the flavour of those beverages represented a pleasure clearly appreciable, since it was also one that could easily be sacrificed, I now imbibed at a sitting, adding to it a few drops of port wine, too much distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just been playing the two louis which I had been saving up for the last month with a view to buying something, I could not remember what. Several of the waiters, set going among the tables, were flying along at full speed, each carrying on his outstretched palms a dish which it seemed to be the object of this kind of race not to let fall. And in fact the chocolate soufflés arrived at their destination unspilled, the potatoes à l’anglaise, in spite of the pace which ought to have sent them flying, came arranged as at the start round the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, plumed with superb black locks, his face dyed in a tint that suggested rather certain species of rare birds than a human being, who, running without pause (and, one would have said, without purpose) from one end of the room to the other, made me think of one of those macaws which fill the big aviaries in zoological gardens with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Presently the spectacle assumed an order, in my eyes at least, growing at once more noble and more calm. All this dizzy activity became fixed in a quiet harmony. I looked at the round tables whose innumerable assemblage filled the restaurant like so many planets as planets are represented in old allegorical pictures. Moreover, there seemed to be some irresistibly attractive force at work among these divers stars, and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables at which they were not sitting, except perhaps some wealthy amphitryon who, having managed to secure a famous author, was endeavouring to extract from him, thanks to the magic properties of the turning table, a few unimportant remarks at which the ladies marvelled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the countless servants who, because instead of being seated like the diners they were on their feet, performed their evolutions in a more exalted sphere. No doubt they were running, one to fetch the hors d’oeuvres, another to change the wine or with clean glasses. But despite these special reasons, their perpetual course among the round tables yielded, after a time, to the observer the law of its dizzy but ordered circulation. Seated behind a bank of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two witches occupied in forecasting by astrological signs the disasters that might from time to time occur in this celestial vault fashioned according to the scientific conceptions of the middle ages

   And I rather pitied all the diners because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not cut through the scheme of things one of those sections which deliver us from the bondage of appearances and enable us to perceive analogies. They thought that they were dining with this or that person, that the dinner would cost roughly so much, and that to-morrow they would begin all over again. And they appeared absolutely unmoved by the progress through their midst of a train of young assistants who, having probably at that moment no urgent duty, advanced processionally bearing rolls of bread in baskets. Some of them, the youngest, stunned by the cuffs which the head waiters administered to them as they passed, fixed melancholy eyes upon a distant dream and were consoled only if some visitor from the Balbec hotel in which they had once been employed, recognising them, said a few words to them, telling them in person to take away the champagne which was not fit to drink, an order that filled them with pride

   I could hear the twinging of my nerves, in which there was a sense of comfort independent of the external objects that might have produced it, a comfort which the least shifting of my body or of my attention was enough to make me feel, just as to a shut eye a slight pressure gives the sensation of colour. I had already drunk a good deal of port wine, and if I now asked for more it was not so much with a view to the comfort which the additional glasses would bring me as an effect of the comfort produced by the glasses that had gone before. I allowed the music itself to guide to each of its notes my pleasure which, meekly following, rested on each in turn. If, like one of those chemical industries by means of which are prepared in large quantities bodies which in a state of nature come together only by accident and very rarely, this restaurant at Rivebelle united at one and the same moment more women to tempt me with beckoning vistas of happiness than the hazard of walks and drives would have made me encounter in a year; on the other hand, this music that greeted our ears — arrangements of waltzes, of German operettas, of music-hall songs, all of them quite new to me — was itself like an ethereal resort of pleasure superimposed upon the other and more intoxicating still. For these tunes, each as individual as a woman, were not keeping, as she would have kept, for some privileged person, the voluptuous secret which they contained: they offered me their secrets, ogled me, came up to me with affected or vulgar movements, accosted me, caressed me as if I had suddenly become more seductive, more powerful and more rich; I indeed found in these tunes an element of cruelty; because any such thing as a disinterested feeling for beauty, a gleam of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasures alone existed. And they are the most merciless of hells, the most gateless and imprisoning for the jealous wretch to whom they present that pleasure — that pleasure which the woman he loves is enjoying with another — as the only thing that exists in the world for her who is all the world to him. But while I was humming softly to myself the notes of this tune, and returning its kiss, the pleasure peculiar to itself which it made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my father and mother, to follow it through the singular world which it constructed in the invisible, in lines instinct with alternate languor and vivacity. Although such a pleasure as this is not calculated to enhance the value of the person to whom it comes, for it is perceived by him alone, and although whenever, in the course of our life, we have failed to attract a woman who has caught sight of us, she could not tell whether at that moment we possessed this inward and subjective felicity which, consequently, could in no way have altered the judgment that she passed on us, I felt myself more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unattractive, at which people might smile, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seductiveness of this music, itself comparable to a friendly atmosphere in which she whom I loved and I were to meet, suddenly grown intimate

   This restaurant was the resort not only of light women; it was frequented also by people in the very best society, who came there for afternoon tea or gave big dinner-parties. The tea-parties were held in a long gallery, glazed and narrow, shaped like a funnel, which led from the entrance hall to the dining-room and was bounded on one side by the garden, from which it was separated (save for a few stone pillars) only by its wall of glass, in which panes would be opened here and there. The result of which, apart from ubiquitous draughts, was sudden and intermittent bursts of sunshine, a dazzling light that made it almost impossible to see the tea-drinkers, so that when they were installed there, at tables crowded pair after pair the whole way along the narrow gully, as they were shot with colours at every movement they made in drinking their tea or in greeting one another, you would have called it a reservoir, a stewpond in which the fisherman has collected all his glittering catch, and the fish, half out of water and bathed in sunlight, dazzle the eye as they mirror an ever-changing iridescence

   A few hours later, during dinner, which, naturally, was served in the dining-room, the lights would be turned on, although it was still quite light out of doors, so that one saw before one’s eyes, in the garden, among summer-houses glimmering in the twilight, like pale spectres of evening, alleys whose greyish verdure was pierced by the last rays of the setting sun and, from the lamp-lit room in which we were dining, appeared through the glass — no longer, as one would have said of the ladies who had been drinking tea there in the afternoon, along the blue and gold corridor, caught in a glittering and dripping net — but like the vegetation of a pale and green aquarium of gigantic size seen by a supernatural light. People began to rise from table; and if each party while their dinner lasted, albeit they spent the whole time examining, recognising, naming the party at the next table, had been held in perfect cohesion about their own, the attractive force that had kept them gravitating round their host of the evening lost its power at the moment when, for coffee, they repaired to the same corridor that had been used for the tea-parties; it often happened that in its passage from place to place some party on the march dropped one or more of its human corpuscles who, having come under the irresistible attraction of the rival party, detached themselves for a moment from their own, in which their places were taken by ladies or gentlemen who had come across to speak to friends before hurrying off with an “I really must fly: I’m dining with M. So-and-So.” And for the moment you would have been reminded, looking at them, of two separate nosegays that had exchanged a few of their flowers. Then the corridor too began to empty. Often, since even after dinner there was still a little light left outside, they left this long corridor unlighted, and, skirted by the trees that overhung it on the other side of the glass, it suggested a pleached alley in a wooded and shady garden. Here and there, in the gloom, a fair diner lingered. As I passed through this corridor one evening on my way out I saw, sitting among a group of strangers, the beautiful Princesse de Luxembourg. I raised my hat without stopping. She remembered me, and bowed her head with a smile; in the air, far above her bowed head, but emanating from the movement, rose melodiously a few words addressed to myself, which must have been a somewhat amplified good-evening, intended not to stop me but simply to complete the gesture, to make it a spoken greeting. But her words remained so indistinct and the sound which was all that I caught was prolonged so sweetly and seemed to me so musical that it seemed as if among the dim branches of the trees a nightingale had begun to sing. If it so happened that, to finish the evening with a party of his friends whom we had met, Saint-Loup decided to go on to the Casino of a neighbouring village, and, taking them with him, put me in a carriage by myself, I would urge the driver to go as fast as he possibly could, so that the minutes might pass less slowly which I must spend without having anyone at hand to dispense me from the obligation myself to provide my sensibility — reversing the engine, so to speak, and emerging from the passivity in which I was caught and held as in the teeth of a machine — with those modifications which, since my arrival at Rivebelle, I had been receiving from other people. The risk of collision with a carriage coming the other way along those lanes where there was barely room for one and it was dark as pitch, the insecurity of the soil, crumbling in many places, at the cliff’s edge, the proximity of its vertical drop to the sea, none of these things exerted on me the slight stimulus that would have been required to bring the vision and the fear of danger within the scope of my reasoning. For just as it is not the desire to become famous but the habit of being laborious that enables us to produce a finished work, so it is not the activity of the present moment but wise reflexions from the past that help us to safeguard the future. But if already, before this point, on my arrival at Rivebelle, I had flung irretrievably away from me those crutches of reason and self-control which help our infirmity to follow the right road, if I now found myself the victim of a sort of moral ataxy, the alcohol that I had drunk, by unduly straining my nerves, gave to the minutes as they came a quality, a charm which did not have the result of leaving me more ready, or indeed more resolute to inhibit them, prevent their coming; for while it made me prefer them a thousand times to anything else in my life, my exaltation made me isolate them from everything else; I was confined to the present, as heroes are or drunkards; eclipsed for the moment, my past no longer projected before me that shadow of itself which we call our future; placing the goal of my life no longer in the realisation of the dreams of that past, but in the felicity of the present moment, I could see nothing now of what lay beyond it. So that, by a contradiction which, however, was only apparent, it was at the very moment in which I was tasting an unfamiliar pleasure, feeling that my life might yet be happy, in which it should have become more precious in my sight; it was at this very moment that, delivered from the anxieties which my life had hitherto contrived to suggest to me, I unhesitatingly abandoned it to the chance of an accident. After all, I was doing no more than concentrate in a single evening the carelessness that, for most men, is diluted throughout their whole existence, in which every day they face, unnecessarily, the dangers of a sea-voyage, of a trip in an aeroplane or motor-car, when there is waiting for them at home the creature whose life their death would shatter, or when there is still stored in the fragile receptacle of their brain that book the approaching publication of which is their one object, now, in life. And so too in the Rivebelle restaurant, on evenings when we just stayed there after dinner, if anyone had come in with the intention of killing me, as I no longer saw, save in a distant prospect too remote to have any reality, my grandmother, my life to come, the books that I was going to write, as I clung now, body and mind, wholly to the scent of the lady at the next table, the politeness of the waiters, the outline of the waltz that the band was playing, as I was glued to my immediate sensation, with no extension beyond its limits, nor any object other than not to be separated from it, I should have died in and with that sensation, I should have let myself be strangled without offering any resistance, without a movement, a bee drugged with tobacco smoke that had ceased to take any thought for preserving the accumulation of its labours and the hopes of its hive

   I ought here to add that this insignificance into which the most serious matters subsided, by contrast with the violence of my exaltation, came in the end to include Mlle. Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them seemed to me easy now but hardly worth the trouble, for my immediate sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary intensity, to the joy that its slightest modifications, its mere continuity provoked, had any importance for me; all the rest — parents, work, pleasures, girls at Balbec weighed with me no more than does a flake of foam in a strong wind that will not let it find a resting place, existed no longer save in relation to this internal power: intoxication makes real for an hour or two a subjective idealism, pure phenomenism; nothing is left now but appearances, nothing exists save as a function of our sublime self. This is not to say that a genuine love, if we have one, cannot survive in such conditions. But we feel so unmistakably, as though in a new atmosphere, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of that sentiment that we can no longer consider it in the old way. It is indeed still there and we shall find it, but in a different place, no longer weighing upon us, satisfied by the sensation which the present affords it, a sensation that is sufficient for us, since for what is not actually present we take no thought. Unfortunately the coefficient which thus alters our values alters them only in the hour of intoxication. The people who had lost all their importance, whom we scattered with our breath like soap-bubbles, will to-morrow resume their density; we shall have to try afresh to settle down to work which this evening had ceased to have any significance. A more serious matter still, these mathematics of the morrow, the same as those of yesterday, in whose problems we shall find ourselves inexorably involved, it is they that govern us even in these hours, and we alone are unconscious of their rule. If there should happen to be, near us, a woman, virtuous or inimical, that question so difficult an hour ago — to know whether we should succeed in finding favour with her — seems to us now a million times easier of solution without having become easier in any respect, for it is only in our own sight, in our own inward sight, that we have altered. And she is as much annoyed with us at this moment as we shall be next day at the thought of our having given a hundred francs to the messenger, and for the same reason which in our case has merely been delayed in its operation, namely the absence of intoxication

   I knew none of the women who were at Rivebelle and, because they formed a part of my intoxication just as its reflexions form part of a mirror, appeared to me now a thousand times more to be desired than the less and less existent Mlle. Simonet. One of them, young, fair, by herself, with a sad expression on a face framed in a straw hat trimmed with field-flowers, gazed at me for a moment with a dreamy air and struck me as being attractive. Then it was the turn of another, and of a third; finally of a dark one with glowing cheeks. Almost all of them were known, if not to myself, to Saint-Loup
   He had, in fact, before he made the acquaintance of his present mistress, lived so much in the restricted world of amorous adventure that all the women who would be dining on these evenings at Rivebelle, where many of them had appeared quite by chance, having come to the coast some to join their lovers, others in the hope of finding fresh lovers there, there was scarcely one that he did not know from having spent — or if not he, one or other of his friends — at least one night in their company. He did not bow to them if they were with men, and they, albeit they looked more at him than at anyone else, for the indifference which he was known to feel towards every woman who was not his mistress gave him in their eyes an exceptional interest, appeared not to know him. But you could hear them whispering: “That’s young Saint-Loup. It seems he’s still quite gone on that girl of his. Got it bad, he has. What a dear boy! I think he’s just wonderful; and what style! Some girls do have all the luck, don’t they? And he’s so nice in every way. I saw a lot of him when I was with d’Orléans. They were quite inseparable, those two. He was going the pace, that time. But he’s given it all up now, she can’t complain. She’s had a good run of luck, that she can say. And I ask you, what in the world can he see in her? He must be a bit of a chump, when all’s said and done. She’s got feet like boats, whiskers like an American, and her undies are filthy. I can tell you, a little shop girl would be ashamed to be seen in her knickers. Do just look at his eyes a moment; you would jump into the fire for a man like that. Hush, don’t say a word; he’s seen me; look, he’s smiling. Oh, he remembers me all right. Just you mention my name to him, and see what he says!” Between these girls and him I surprised a glance of mutual understanding. I should have liked him to introduce me to them, so that I might ask them for assignations and they give them to me, even if I had been unable to keep them. For otherwise their appearance would remain for all time devoid, in my memory, of that part of itself — just as though it had been hidden by a veil — which varies in every woman, which we cannot imagine in any woman until we have actually seen it in her, and which is apparent only in the glance that she directs at us, that acquiesces in our desire and promises that it shall be satisfied. And yet, even when thus reduced, their aspect was for me far more than that of women whom I should have known to be virtuous, and it seemed to me not to be, like theirs, flat, with nothing behind it, fashioned in one piece with no solidity. It was not, of course, for me what it must be for Saint-Loup who, by an act of memory, beneath the indifference, transparent to him, of the motionless features which affected not to know him, or beneath the dull formality of the greeting that might equally well have been addressed to anyone else, could recall, could see, through dishevelled locks, a swooning mouth, a pair of half-closed eyes, a whole silent picture like those that painters, to cheat their visitors’ senses, drape with a decent covering. Undoubtedly, for me who felt that nothing of my personality had penetrated the surface of this woman or that, or would be borne by her upon the unknown ways which she would tread through life, those faces remained sealed. But it was quite enough to know that they did open, for them to seem to me of a price which I should not have set on them had they been but precious medals, instead of lockets within which were hidden memories of love. As for Robert, scarcely able to keep in his place at table, concealing beneath a courtier’s smile his warrior’s thirst for action — when I examined him I could see how closely the vigorous structure of his triangular face must have been modelled on that of his ancestors’ faces, a face devised rather for an ardent bowman than for a delicate student. Beneath his fine skin the bold construction, the feudal architecture were apparent. His head made one think of those old dungeon keeps on which the disused battlements are still to be seen, although inside they have been converted into libraries

   On our way back to Balbec, of those of the fair strangers to whom he had introduced me I would repeat to myself without a moment’s interruption, and yet almost unconsciously: “What a delightful woman!” as one chimes in with the refrain of a song. I admit that these words were prompted rather by the state of my nerves than by any lasting judgment. It was nevertheless true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and if there had still been a jeweller’s shop open at that hour, I should have bought the lady a ring. When the successive hours of our life are thus displayed against too widely dissimilar backgrounds, we find that we give away too much of ourselves to all sorts of people who next day will not interest us in the least. But we feel that we are still responsible for what we said to them overnight, and that we must honour our promises

   As on these evenings I came back later than usual to the hotel, it was with joy that I recognised, in a room no longer hostile, the bed on which, on the day of my arrival, I had supposed that it would always be impossible for me to find any rest, whereas now my weary limbs turned to it for support; so that, in turn, thighs, hips, shoulders burrowed into, trying to adhere at every angle to, the sheets that covered its mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wished to take a cast of an entire human body. But I could not go to sleep; I felt the approach of morning; peace of mind, health of body, were no longer mine. In my distress it seemed that never should I recapture them. I should have had to sleep for a long time if I were to overtake them. But then, had I begun to doze, I must in any event be awakened in a couple of hours by the symphonic concert on the beach. Suddenly I was asleep, I had fallen into that deep slumber in which are opened to us a return to childhood, the recapture of past years, of lost feelings, the disincarnation, the transmigration of the soul, the evoking of the dead, the illusions of madness, retrogression towards the most elementary of the natural kingdoms (for we say that we often see animals in our dreams, but we forget almost always that we are ourself then an animal deprived of that reasoning power which projects upon things the light of certainty; we present on the contrary to the spectacle of life only a dubious vision, destroyed afresh every moment by oblivion, the former reality fading before that which follows it as one projection of a magic lantern fades before the next as we change the slide), all those mysteries which we imagine ourselves not to know and into which we are in reality initiated almost every night, as we are into the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. Rendered more vagabond by the difficulty of digesting my Rivebelle dinner, the successive and flickering illumination of shadowy zones of my past made of me a being whose supreme happiness would have been that of meeting Legrandin, with whom I had just been talking in my dream

   And then, even my own life was entirely hidden from me by a new setting, like the ‘drop’ lowered right at the front of the stage before which, while the scene snifters are busy behind, actors appear in a fresh ‘turn.’ The turn in which I was now cast for a part was in the manner of an Oriental fairy-tale; I retained no knowledge of my past or of myself, on account of the intense proximity of this interpolated scenery; I was merely a person who received the bastinado and underwent various punishments for a crime the nature of which I could not distinguish, though it was actually that of having taken too much port wine. Suddenly I awoke and discovered that, thanks to a long sleep, I had not heard a note of the concert. It was already afternoon; I verified this by my watch after several efforts to sit up in bed, efforts fruitless at first and interrupted by backward falls on to my pillow, but those short falls which are a sequel of sleep as of other forms of intoxication, whether due to wine or to convalescence; besides, before I had so much as looked at the time, I was certain that it was past midday. Last night I had been nothing more than an empty vessel, without weight, and (since I must first have gone to bed to be able to keep still, and have been asleep to be able to keep silent) had been unable to refrain from moving about and talking; I had no longer any stability, any centre of gravity, I was set in motion and it seemed that I might have continued on my dreary course until I reached the moon. But if, while I slept, my eyes had not seen the time, my body had nevertheless contrived to calculate it, had measured the hours; not on a dial superficially marked and figured, but by the steadily growing weight of all my replenished forces which, like, a powerful clockwork, it had allowed, notch by notch, to descend from my brain into the rest of my body in which there had risen now to above my knees the unbroken abundance of their store. If it is true that the sea was once upon a time our native element, into which we must plunge our cooling blood if we are to recover our strength, it is the same with the oblivion, the mental non-existence of sleep; we seem then to absent ourselves for a few hours from Time, but the forces which we have gathered in that interval without expending them, measure it by their quantity as accurately as the pendulum of the clock or the crumbling pyramid of the sandglass. Nor does one emerge more easily from such sleep than from a prolonged spell of wakefulness, so strongly does everything tend to persist; and if it is true that certain narcotics make us sleep, to have slept for any time is an even stronger narcotic, after which we have great difficulty in making ourselves wake up. Like a sailor who sees plainly the harbour in which he can moor his vessel, still tossed by the waves, I had a quite definite idea of looking at the time and of getting up, but my body was at every moment cast back upon the tide of sleep; the landing was difficult, and before I attained a position in which I could reach my watch and confront with its time that indicated by the wealth of accumulated material which my stiffened limbs had at their disposal, I fell back two or three times more upon my pillow

   At length I could reach and read it: “Two o’clock in the afternoon!” I rang; but at once I returned to a slumber which, this time, must have lasted infinitely longer, if I was to judge by the refreshment, the vision of an immense night overpassed, which I found on awakening. And yet as my awakening was caused by the entry of Françoise, and as her entry had been prompted by my ringing the bell, this second sleep which, it seemed to me, must have been longer than the other, and had brought me so much comfort and forgetfulness, could not have lasted for more than half a minute

   My grandmother opened the door of my bedroom; I asked her various questions about the Legrandin family

   It is not enough to say that I had returned to tranquillity and health, for it was more than a mere interval of space that had divided them from me yesterday, I had had all night long to struggle against a contrary tide, and now I not only found myself again in their presence, they had once more entered into me. At certain definite and still somewhat painful points beneath the surface of my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape for all time, those ideas had once again taken their proper places and resumed that existence by which hitherto, alas, they had failed to profit

   Once again I had escaped from the impossibility of sleeping, from the deluge, the shipwreck of my nervous storms. I feared now not at all the menaces that had loomed over me the evening before, when I was dismantled of repose. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still shattered, although quite alert and well, I savoured my weariness with a light heart; it had isolated and broken asunder the bones of my legs and arms, which I could feel assembled before me, ready to cleave together, and which I was to raise to life merely by singing, like the builder in the fable

   Suddenly I thought of the fair girl with the sad expression whom I had seen at Rivebelle, where she had looked at me for a moment. Many others, in the course of the evening, had seemed to me attractive; now she alone arose from the dark places of my memory. I had felt that she noticed me, had expected one of the waiters to come to me with a whispered message from her. Saint-Loup did not know her and fancied that she was respectable. It would be very difficult to see her, to see her constantly. But I was prepared to make any sacrifice, I thought now only of her. Philosophy distinguishes often between free and necessary acts. Perhaps there is none to the necessity of which we are more completely subjected than that which, by virtue of an ascending power held in check during the act itself, makes so unfailingly (once our mind is at rest) spring up a memory that was levelled with other memories by the distributed pressure of our indiffer-ance, and rush to the surface, because unknown to us it contained, more than any of the others, a charm of which we do not become aware until the following day. And perhaps there is not, either, any act so free, for it is still unprompted by habit, by that sort of mental hallucination which, when we are in love, facilitates the invariable reappearance of the image of one particular person

   This was the day immediately following that on which I had seen file past me against a background of sea the beautiful procession of young girls. I put questions about them to a number of the visitors in the hotel, people who came almost every year to Balbec. They could tell me nothing. Later on, a photograph shewed me why. Who could ever recognise now in them, scarcely and yet quite definitely beyond an age in which one changes so utterly, that amorphous, delicious mass, still wholly infantine, of little girls who, only a few years back, might have been seen sitting in a ring on the sand round a tent; a sort of white and vague constellation in which one would have distinguished a pair of eyes that sparkled more than the rest, a mischievous face, flaxen hair, only to lose them again and to confound them almost at once in the indistinct and milky nebula

   No doubt, in those earlier years that were still so recent, it was not, as it had been yesterday when they appeared for the first time before me, one’s impression of the group, but the group itself that had been lacking in clearness. Then those children, mere babies, had been still at that elementary stage in their formation when personality has not set its seal on every face. Like those primitive organisms in which the individual barely exists by itself, consists in the reef rather than in the coral insects that compose it, they were still pressed one against another. Sometimes one pushed her neighbour over, and then a wild laugh, which seemed the sole manifestation of their personal life, convulsed them all at once, obliterating, confounding those indefinite, grinning faces in the congealment of a single cluster, scintillating and tremulous. In an old photograph of themselves, which they were one day to give me, and which I have kept ever since, their infantile troop already presents the same number of participants as, later, their feminine procession; one can see from it that their presence must, even then, have made on the beach an unusual mark which forced itself on the attention; but one cannot recognise them individually in it save by a process of reasoning, leaving a clear field to all the transformations possible during girlhood, up to the point at which one reconstructed form would begin to encroach upon another individuality, which must be identified also, and whose handsome face, owing to the accessories of a large build and curly hair, may quite possibly have been, once, that wizened and impish little grin which the photograph album presents to us; and the distance traversed in a short interval of time by the physical characteristics of each of these girls making of them a criterion too vague to be of any use, whereas what they had in common and, so to speak, collectively, had at that early date been strongly marked, it sometimes happened that even their most intimate friends mistook one for another in this photograph, so much so that the question could in the last resort be settled only by some detail of costume which one of them could be certain that she herself, and not any of the others, had worn. Since those days, so different from the day on which I had just seen them strolling along the ‘front,’ so different and yet so close in time, they still gave way to fits of laughter, as I had observed that afternoon, but to laughter of a kind that was no longer the intermittent and almost automatic laughter of childhood, a spasmodic discharge which, in those days, had continually sent their heads dipping out of the circle, as the clusters of minnows in the Vivonne used to scatter and vanish only to gather again a moment later; each countenance was now mistress of itself, their eyes were fixed on the goal towards which they were marching; and it had taken, yesterday, the indecision and tremulousness of my first impression to make me confuse vaguely (as their childish hilarity and the old photograph had confused) the spores now individualised and disjoined of the pale madrepore

   Repeatedly, I dare say, when pretty girls went by, I had promised myself that I would see them again. As a rule, people do not appear a second time; moreover our memory, which speedily forgets their existence, would find it difficult to recall their appearance; our eyes would not recognise them, perhaps, and in the meantime we have seen new girls go by, whom we shall not see again either. But at other times, and this was what was to happen with the pert little band at Balbec, chance brings them back insistently before our eyes. Chance seems to us then a good and useful thing, for we discern in it as it were rudiments of organisation, of an attempt to arrange our life; and it makes easy to us, inevitable, and sometimes — after interruptions that have made us hope that we may cease to remember — cruel, the retention in our minds of images to the possession of which we shall come in time to believe that we were predestined, and which but for chance we should from the very first have managed to forget, like so many others, with so little difficulty

   Presently Saint-Loup’s visit drew to an end. I had not seen that party of girls again on the beach. He was too little at Balbec in the afternoons to have time to bother about them, or to attempt, in my interest, to make their acquaintance. In the evenings he was more free, and continued to take me constantly to Rivebelle. There are, in those restaurants, as there are in public gardens and railway trains, people embodied in a quite ordinary appearance, whose name astonishes us when, having happened to ask it, we discover that this is not the mere inoffensive stranger whom we supposed but nothing less than the Minister or Duke of whom we have so often heard. Two or three times already, in the Rivebelle restaurant, we had — Saint-Loup and I— seen come in and sit down at a table when everyone else was getting ready to go, a man of large stature, very muscular, with regular features and a grizzled beard, gazing, with concentrated attention, into the empty air. One evening, on our asking the landlord who was this obscure, solitary and belated diner, “What!” he exclaimed, “do you mean to say you don’t know the famous painter Elstir?” Swann had once mentioned his name to me, I had entirely forgotten in what connexion; but the omission of a particular memory, like that of part of a sentence when we are reading, leads sometimes not to uncertainty but to a birth of certainty that is premature. “He is a friend of Swann, a very well known artist, extremely good,” I told Saint-Loup. Whereupon there passed over us both, like a wave of emotion, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a celebrated man, and that, confounding us with the rest of the diners, he had no suspicion of the ecstasy into which we were thrown by the idea of his talent. Doubtless, his unconsciousness of our admiration and of our acquaintance with Swann would not have troubled us had we not been at the seaside. But since we were still at an age when enthusiasm cannot keep silence, and had been transported into a life in which not to be known is unendurable, we wrote a letter, signed with both our names, in which we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated within a few feet of him two passionate admirers of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and asked to be allowed to pay our homage to him in person. A waiter undertook to convey this missive to the celebrity

   A celebrity Elstir was, perhaps, not yet at this period quite to the extent claimed by the landlord, though he was to reach the height of his fame within a very few years. But he had been one of the first to frequent this restaurant when it was still only a sort of farmhouse, and had brought to it a whole colony of artists (who had all, as it happened, migrated elsewhere as soon as the farm-yard in which they used to feed in the open air, under a lean-to roof, had become a fashionable centre); Elstir himself had returned to Rivebelle this evening only on account of a temporary absence of his wife, from the house which he had taken in the neighbourhood. But great talent, even when its existence is not yet recognised, will inevitably provoke certain phenomena of admiration, such as the landlord had managed to detect in the questions asked by more than one English lady visitor, athirst for information as to the life led by Elstir, or in the number of letters that he received from abroad. Then the landlord had further remarked that Elstir did not like to be disturbed when he was working, that he would rise in the middle of the night and take a little model down to the water’s edge to pose for him, nude, if the moon was shining; and had told himself that so much labour was not in vain, nor the admiration of the tourists unjustified when he had, in one of Elstir’s pictures, recognised a wooden cross which stood by the roadside as you came into Rivebelle

    “It’s all right!” he would repeat with stupefaction, “there are all the four beams! Oh, he does take a lot of trouble!”

   And he did not know whether a little Sunrise Over the Sea which Elstir had given him might not be worth a fortune

   We watched him read our letter, put it in his pocket, finish his dinner, begin to ask for his things, get up to go; and we were so convinced that we had shocked him by our overture that we would now have hoped (as keenly as at first we had dreaded) to make our escape without his noticing us. We did not bear in mind for a single instant a consideration which should, nevertheless, have seemed to us most important, namely that our enthusiasm for Elstir, on the sincerity of which we should not have allowed the least doubt to be cast, which we could indeed have supported with the evidence of our breathing arrested by expectancy, our desire to do no matter what that was difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined it to be, admiration, since neither of us had ever seen anything that he had painted; our feeling might have as its object the hollow idea of a ‘great artist,’ but not a body of work which was unknown to us. It was, at the most, admiration in the abstract, the nervous envelope, the sentimental structure of an admiration without content, that is to say a thing as indissolubly attached to boyhood as are certain organs which have ceased to exist in the adult man; we were still boys. Elstir meanwhile was reaching the door when suddenly he turned and came towards us. I was transported by a delicious thrill of terror such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, while age diminishes our capacity, familiarity with the world has meanwhile destroyed in us any inclination to provoke such strange encounters, to feel that kind of emotion

   In the course of the few words that Elstir had come back to say to us, sitting down at our table, he never gave any answer on the several occasions on which I spoke to him of Swann. I began to think that he did not know him. He asked me, nevertheless, to come and see him at his Balbec studio, an invitation which he did not extend to Saint-Loup, and which I had earned (as I might not, perhaps, from Swann’s recommendation, had Elstir been intimate with him, for the part played by disinterested motives is greater than we are inclined to think in people’s lives) by a few words which made him think that I was devoted to the arts. He lavished on me a friendliness which was as far above that of Saint-Loup as that was above the affability of a mere tradesman. Compared with that of a great artist, the friendliness of a great gentleman, charming as it may be, has the effect of an actor’s playing a part, of being feigned. Saint-Loup sought to please; Elstir loved to give, to give himself. Everything that he possessed, ideas, work, and the rest which he counted for far less, he would have given gladly to anyone who could understand him. But, failing society that was endurable, he lived in an isolation, with a savagery which fashionable people called pose and ill-breeding, public authorities a recalcitrant spirit, his neighbours madness, his family selfishness and pride

   And no doubt at first he had thought, even in his solitude, with enjoyment that, thanks to his work, he was addressing, in spite of distance, he was giving a loftier idea of himself, to those who had misunderstood or hurt him. Perhaps, in those days, he lived alone not from indifference but from love of his fellows, and, just as I had renounced Gilberte to appear to her again one day in more attractive colours, dedicated his work to certain people as a way of approaching them again, by which without actually seeing him they would be made to love him, admire him, talk about him; a renunciation is not always complete from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from the society to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we knew it to be incompatible with smaller things to which we clung, and of which it does not so much deprive us as it detaches us from them. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it

   Elstir did not stay long talking to us. I made up my mind that I would go to his studio during the next few days, but on the following afternoon, when I had accompanied my grandmother right to the point at which the ‘front’ ended, near the cliffs of Canapville, on our way back, at the foot of one of the little streets which ran down at right angles to the beach, we came upon a girl who, with lowered head like an animal that is being driven reluctant to its stall, and carrying golf-clubs, was walking in front of a person in authority, in all probability her or her friends’ ‘Miss,’ who suggested a portrait of Jeffreys by Hogarth, with a face as red as if her favourite beverage were gin rather than tea, on which a dried smear of tobacco at the corner of her mouth prolonged the curve of a moustache that was grizzled but abundant. The girl who preceded her was like that one of the little band who, beneath a black polo-cap, had shewn in an inexpressive chubby face a pair of laughing eyes. Now, the girl who was now passing me had also a black polo-cap, but she struck me as being even prettier than the other, the line of her nose was straighter, the curve of nostril at its base fuller and more fleshy. Besides, the other had seemed a proud, pale girl, this one a child well-disciplined and of rosy complexion. And yet, as she was pushing a bicycle just like the other’s, and was wearing the same reindeer gloves, I concluded that the differences arose perhaps from the angle and circumstances in which I now saw her, for it was hardly likely that there could be at Balbec a second girl, with a face that, when all was said, was so similar and with the same details in her accoutrements. She cast a rapid glance in my direction; for the next few days, when I saw the little band again on the beach, and indeed long afterwards when I knew all the girls who composed it, I could never be absolutely certain that any of them — even she who among them all was most like her, the girl with the bicycle — was indeed the one that I had seen that evening at the end of the ‘front,’ where a street ran down to the beach, a girl who differed hardly at all, but was still just perceptibly different from her whom I had noticed in the procession

   From that moment, whereas for the last few days my mind had been occupied chiefly by the tall one, it was the one with the golf-clubs, presumed to be Mlle. Simonet, who began once more to absorb my attention. When walking with the others she would often stop, forcing her friends, who seemed greatly to respect her, to stop also. Thus it is, calling a halt, her eyes sparkling beneath her polo-cap, that I see her again to-day, outlined against the screen which the sea spreads out behind her, and separated from me by a transparent, azure space, the interval of time that has elapsed since then, a first impression, faint and fine in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then found again, of a face which I have many times since projected upon the cloud of the past to be able to say to myself, of a girl who was actually in my room: “It is she!” But it was perhaps yet another, the one with geranium cheeks and green eyes, whom I should have liked most to know. And yet, whichever of them it might be, on any given day, that I preferred to see, the others, without her, were sufficient to excite my desire which, concentrated now chiefly on one, now on another, continued — as, on the first day, my confused vision — to combine and blend them, to make of them the little world apart, animated by a life in common, which for that matter they doubtless imagined themselves to form; and I should have penetrated, in becoming a friend of one of them — like a cultivated pagan or a meticulous Christian going among barbarians — into a rejuvenating society in which reigned health, unconsciousness of others, sensual pleasures, cruelty, unintellectuality and joy

   My grandmother, who had been told of my meeting with Elstir, and rejoiced at the thought of all the intellectual profit that I might derive from his friendship, considered it absurd and none too polite of me not to have gone yet to pay him a visit. But I could think only of the little band, and being uncertain of the hour at which the girls would be passing along the front, I dared not absent myself. My grandmother was astonished, too, at the smartness of my attire, for I had suddenly remembered suits which had been lying all this time at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and had even written to Paris ordering new hats and neckties

   It adds a great charm to life in a watering-place like Balbec if the face of a pretty girl, a vendor of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in vivid colours in our mind, is regularly, from early morning, the purpose of each of those leisured, luminous days which we spend upon the beach. They become then, and for that reason, albeit unoccupied by any business, as alert as working-days, pointed, magnetised, raised slightly to meet an approaching moment, that in which, while we purchase sand-cakes, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing upon a feminine face its colours displayed as purely as on a flower. But at least, with these little traffickers, first of all we can speak to them, which saves us from having to construct with our imagination their aspects other than those with which the mere visual perception of them furnishes us, and to recreate their life, magnifying its charm, as when we stand before a portrait; moreover, just because we speak to them, we can learn where and at what time it will be possible to see them again. Now I had none of these advantages with respect to the little band. Their habits were unknown to me; when on certain days I failed to catch a glimpse of them, not knowing the cause of their absence I sought to discover whether it was something fixed and regular, if they were to be seen only every other day, or in certain states of the weather, or if there were days on which no one ever saw them. I imagined myself already friends with them, and saying: “But you weren’t there the other day?” “Weren’t we? Oh, no, of course not; that was because it was a Saturday. On Saturdays we don’t ever come, because . . . ” If it were only as simple as that, to know that on black Saturday it was useless to torment oneself, that one might range the beach from end to end, sit down outside the pastry-cook’s and pretend to be nibbling an éclair, poke into the curiosity shop, wait for bathing time, the concert, high tide, sunset, night, all without seeing the longed-for little band. But the fatal day did not, perhaps, come once a week. It did not, perhaps, of necessity fall on Saturdays. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced it or were entirely unconnected with it. How many observations, patient but not at all serene, must one accumulate of the movements, to all appearance irregular, of those unknown worlds before being able to be sure that one has not allowed oneself to be led astray by mere coincidence, that one’s forecasts will not be proved wrong, before one elucidates the certain laws, acquired at the cost of so much painful experience, of that passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not yet seen them on some particular day of the week, I assured myself that they would not be coming, that it was useless to wait any longer on the beach. And at that very moment I caught sight of them. And yet on another day which, so far as I could suppose that there were laws that guided the return of those constellations, must, I had calculated, prove an auspicious day, they did not come. But to this primary uncertainty whether I should see them or not that day, there was added another, more disquieting: whether I should ever set eyes on them again, for I had no reason, after all, to know that they were not about to sail for America, or to return to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to love them. One can feel an attraction towards a particular person. But to release that fount of sorrow, that sense of the irreparable, those agonies which prepare the way for love, there must be — and this is, perhaps, more than any person can be, the actual object which our passion seeks so anxiously to embrace — the risk of an impossibility. Thus there were acting upon me already those influences which recur in the course of our successive love-affairs, which can, for that matter, be provoked (but then rather in the life of cities) by the thought of little working girls whose half-holiday is we know not on what day, and whom we are afraid of having missed as they came out of the factory; or which at least have recurred in mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps everything that formed a distinctive feature of our first love attaches itself to those that come after, by recollection, suggestion, habit, and through the successive periods of our life gives to its different aspects a general character

   I seized every pretext for going down to the beach at the hours when I hoped to succeed in finding them there. Having caught sight of them once while we were at luncheon, I now invariably came in late for it, waiting interminably upon the ‘front’ for them to pass; devoting all the short time that I did spend in the dining-room to interrogating with my eyes its azure wall of glass; rising long before the dessert, so as not to miss them should they have gone out at a different hour, and chafing with irritation at my grandmother, when, with unwitting malevolence, she made me stay with her past the hour that seemed to me propitious. I tried to prolong the horizon by setting my chair aslant; if, by chance, I did catch sight of no matter which of the girls, since they all partook of the same special essence, it was as if I had seen projected before my face in a shifting, diabolical hallucination, a little of the unfriendly and yet passionately coveted dream which, but a moment ago, had existed only — where it lay stagnant for all time — in my brain

   I was in love with none of them, loving them all, and yet the possibility of meeting them was in my daily life the sole element of delight, alone made to burgeon in me those high hopes by which every obstacle is surmounted, hopes ending often in fury if I had not seen them. For the moment, these girls eclipsed my grandmother in my affection; the longest journey would at once have seemed attractive to me had it been to a place in which they might be found. It was to them that my thoughts comfortably clung when I supposed myself to be thinking of something else or of nothing. But when, even without knowing it, I thought of them, they, more unconsciously still, were for me the mountainous blue undulations of the sea, a troop seen passing in outline against the waves. Our most intensive love for a person is always the love, really, of something else as well

   Meanwhile my grandmother was shewing, because now I was keenly interested in golf and lawn-tennis and was letting slip an opportunity of seeing at work and hearing talk an artist whom she knew to be one of the greatest of his time, a disapproval which seemed to me to be based on somewhat narrow views. I had guessed long ago in the Champs-Elysées, and had since established to my own satisfaction, that when we are in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our own soul, that the important thing is, therefore, not the worth of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions which a young girl of no kind of distinction arouses in us can enable us to bring to the surface of our consciousness some of the most intimate parts of our being, more personal, more remote, more essential than would be reached by the pleasure that we derive from the conversation of a great man or even from the admiring contemplation of his work

   I was to end by complying with my grandmother’s wishes, all the more reluctantly in that Elstir lived at some distance from the ‘front’ in one of the newest of Balbec’s avenues. The heat of the day obliged me to take the tramway which passed along the Rue de la Plage, and I made an effort (so as still to believe that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the country it might be, of King Mark, or upon the site of the Forest of Broceliande) not to see the gimcrack splendour of the buildings that extended on either hand, among which Elstir’s villa was perhaps the most sumptuously hideous, in spite of which he had taken it, because, of all that there were to be had at Balbec, it was the only one that provided him with a really big studio

   It was also with averted eyes that I crossed the garden, which had a lawn — in miniature, like any little suburban villa round Paris — a statuette of an amorous gardener, glass balls in which one saw one’s distorted reflexion, beds of begonias and a little arbour, beneath which rocking chairs were drawn up round an iron table. But after all these preliminaries hallmarked with philistine ugliness, I took no notice of the chocolate mouldings on the plinths once I was in the studio; I felt perfectly happy, for, with the help of all the sketches and studies that surrounded me, I foresaw the possibility of raising myself to a poetical understanding, rich in delights, of many forms which I had not, hitherto, isolated from the general spectacle of reality. And Elstir’s studio appeared to me as the laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world in which, from the chaos that is all the things we see, he had extracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas that were hung everywhere about the room, here a wave of the sea crushing angrily on the sand its lilac foam, there a young man in a suit of white linen, leaning upon the rail of a vessel. His jacket and the spattering wave had acquired fresh dignity from the fact that they continued to exist, even although they were deprived of those qualities in which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able to splash nor the jacket to clothe anyone

   At the moment at which I entered, the creator was just finishing, with the brush which he had in his hand, the form of the sun at its setting

   The shutters were closed almost everywhere round the studio, which was fairly cool and, except in one place where daylight laid against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; there was open only one little rectangular window embowered in honeysuckle, which, over a strip of garden, gave on an avenue; so that the atmosphere of the greater part of the studio was dusky, transparent and compact in the mass, but liquid and sparkling at the rifts where the golden clasp of sunlight banded it, like a lump of rock crystal of which one surface, already cut and polished, here and there, gleams like a mirror with iridescent rays. While Elstir, at my request, went on painting, I wandered about in the half-light, stopping to examine first one picture, then another

   Most of those that covered the walls were not what I should chiefly have liked to see of his work, paintings in what an English art journal which lay about on the reading-room table in the Grand Hotel called his first and second manners, the mythological manner and the manner in which he shewed signs of Japanese influence, both admirably exemplified, the article said, in the collection of Mme. de Guermantes. Naturally enough, what he had in his studio were almost all seascapes done here, at Balbec. But I was able to discern from these that the charm of each of them lay in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented in it, analogous to what in poetry we call metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created them anew. The names which denote things correspond invariably to an intellectual notion, alien to our true impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that is not in keeping with itself

   Sometimes in my window in the hotel at Balbec, in the morning when Françoise undid the fastenings of the curtains that shut out the light, in the evening when I was waiting until it should be time to go out with Saint-Loup, I had been led by some effect of sunlight to mistake what was only a darker stretch of sea for a distant coastline, or to gaze at a belt of liquid azure without knowing whether it belonged to sea or sky. But presently my reason would re-establish between the elements that distinction which in my first impression I had overlooked. In the same way I used, in Paris, in my bedroom, to hear a dispute, almost a. riot, in the street below, until I had referred back to its cause — a carriage for instance that was rattling towards me — this noise, from which I now eliminated the shrill and discordant vociferations which my ear had really heard but which my reason knew that wheels did not produce. But the rare moments in which we see nature as she is, with poetic vision, it was from those that Elstir’s work was taken. One of his metaphors that occurred most commonly in the seascapes which he had round him was precisely that which, comparing land with sea, suppressed every line of demarcation between them. It was this comparison, tacitly and untiringly repeated on a single canvas, which gave it that multiform and powerful unity, the cause (not always clearly perceived by themselves) of the enthusiasm which Elstir’s work aroused in certain collectors

   It was, for instance, for a metaphor of this sort — in a picture of the harbour of Carquethuit, a picture which he had finished a few days earlier and at which I now stood gazing my fill — that Elstir had prepared the mind of the spectator by employing, for the little town, only marine terms, and urban terms for the sea. Whether its houses concealed a part of the harbour, a dry dock, or perhaps the sea itself came cranking in among the land, as constantly happened on the Balbec coast, on the other side of the promontory on which the town was built the roofs were overtopped (as it had been by mill-chimneys or church-steeples) by masts which had the effect of making the vessels to which they belonged appear town-bred, built on land, an impression which was strengthened by the sight of other boats, moored along the jetty but in such serried ranks that you could see men talking across from one deck to another without being able to distinguish the dividing line, the chink of water between them, so that this fishing fleet seemed less to belong to the water than, for instance, the churches of Criquebec which, in the far distance, surrounded by water on every side because you saw them without seeing the town, in a powdery haze of sunlight and crumbling waves, seemed to be emerging from the waters, blown in alabaster or in sea-foam, and, enclosed in the band of a particoloured rainbow, to form an unreal, a mystical picture. On the beach in the foreground the painter had arranged that the eye should discover no fixed boundary, no absolute line of demarcation between earth and ocean. The men who were pushing down their boats into the sea were running as much through the waves as along the sand, which, being wet, reflected their hulls as if they were already in the water. The sea itself did not come up in an even line but followed the irregularities of the shore, which the perspective of the picture increased still further, so that a ship actually at sea, half-hidden by the projecting works of the arsenal, seemed to be sailing across the middle of the town; women who were gathering shrimps among the rocks had the appearance, because they were surrounded by water and because of the depression which, after the ringlike barrier of rocks, brought the beach (on the side nearest the land) down to sea-level, of being in a marine grotto overhung by ships and waves, open yet unharmed in the path of a miraculously averted tide. If the whole picture gave this impression of harbours in which the sea entered into the land, in which the land was already subaqueous and the population amphibian, the strength of the marine element was everywhere apparent; and round about the rocks, at the mouth of the harbour, where the sea was rough, you felt from the muscular efforts of the fishermen and the obliquity of the boats leaning over at an acute angle, compared with the calm erect-ness of the warehouse on the harbour, the church, the houses of the town to which some of the figures were returning while others were coming out to fish, that they were riding bareback on the water, as it might be a swift and fiery animal whose rearing, but for their skill, must have unseated them. A party of holiday makers were putting gaily out to sea in a boat that tossed like a jaunting-car on a rough road; their boatman, blithe but attentive, also, to what he was doing, trimmed the bellying sail, every one kept in his place, so that the weight should not be all on one side of the boat, which might capsize, and so they went racing over sunlit fields into shadowy places, dashing down into the troughs of waves. It was a fine morning in spite of the recent storm. Indeed, one could still feel the powerful activities that must first be neutralized in order to attain the easy balance of the boats that lay motionless, enjoying sunshine and breeze, in parts where the sea was so calm that its reflexions had almost more solidity and reality than the floating hulls, vaporised by an effect of the sunlight, parts which the perspective of the picture dovetailed in among others. Or rather you would not have called them other parts of the sea. For between those parts there was as much difference as there was between one of them and the church rising from the water, or the ships behind the town. Your reason then set to work and made a single element of what was here black beneath a gathering storm, a little farther all of one colour with the sky and as brightly burnished, and elsewhere so bleached by sunshine, haze and foam, so compact, so terrestrial, so circumscribed with houses that you thought of some white stone causeway or of a field of snow, up the surface of which it was quite frightening to see a ship go climbing high and dry, as a carriage climbs dripping from a ford, but which a moment later, when you saw on the raised and broken surface of the solid plain boats drunkenly heaving, you understood, identical in all these different aspects, to be still the sea

   Although we are justified in saying that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that the artist who begins afresh upon his own account an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered by the efforts of all the others, we must nevertheless admit that, in so far as art brings into prominence certain laws, once an industry has taken those laws and vulgarised them, the art that was first in the field loses, in retrospect, a little of its originality. Since Elstir began to paint, we have grown familiar with what are called ‘admirable’ photographs of scenery and towns. If we press for a definition of what their admirers mean by the epithet, we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual picture of a familiar object, a picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us because it startles us, makes us emerge from our habits and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to us an earlier impression. For instance, one of these ‘magnificent’ photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will shew us some cathedral which we are accustomed to see in the middle of a town, taken instead from a selected point of view from which it will appear to be thirty times the height of the houses and to be thrusting a spur out from the bank of the river, from which it is actually a long way off. Now the effort made by Elstir to reproduce things not as he knew them to be but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed, had led him exactly to this point; he gave special emphasis to certain of these laws of perspective, which were thus all the more striking, since his art had been their first interpreter. A river, because of the windings of its course, a bay because of the apparent contact of the cliffs on either side of it, would look as though there had been hollowed out in the heart of the plain or of the mountains a lake absolutely landlocked on every side. In a picture of a view from Balbec painted upon a scorching day in summer an inlet of the sea appeared to be enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began farther out. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by the gulls which, wheeling over what, when one looked at the picture, seemed to be solid rock, were as a matter of fact inhaling the moist vapour of the shifting tide. Other laws were discernible in the same canvas, as, at the foot of immense cliffs, the lilliputian grace of white sails on the blue mirror on whose surface they looked like butterflies asleep, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallidity of the light. This play of light and shade, which also photography has rendered commonplace, had interested Elstir so much that at one time he had painted what were almost mirages, in which a castle crowned with a tower appeared as a perfect circle of castle prolonged by a tower at its summit, and at its foot by an inverted tower, whether because the exceptional purity of the atmosphere on a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brightness of the stone, or because the morning mists rendered the stone as vaporous as the shadow. And similarly, beyond the sea, behind a line of woods, began another sea roseate with the light of the setting sun, which was, in fact, the sky. The light, as it were precipitating new solids, thrust back the hull of the boat on which it fell behind the other hull that was still in shadow, and rearranged like the steps of a crystal staircase what was materially a plane surface, but was broken up by the play of light and shade upon the morning sea. A river running beneath the bridges of a town was caught from a certain point of view so that it appeared entirely dislocated, now broadened into a lake, now narrowed into a rivulet, broken elsewhere by the interruption of a hill crowned with trees among which the burgher would repair at evening to taste the refreshing breeze; and the rhythm of this disintegrated town was assured only by the inflexible uprightness of the steeples which did not rise but rather, following the plumb line of the pendulum marking its cadence as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense beneath them all the confused mass of houses that rose vaguely in the mist along the banks of the crushed, disjointed stream. And (since Elstir’s earliest work belonged to the time in which a painter would make his landscape attractive by inserting a human figure), on the cliff’s edge or among the mountains, the road, that half human part of nature, underwent, like river or ocean, the eclipses of perspective. And whether a sheer wall of mountain, or the mist blown from a torrent, or the sea prevented the eye from following the continuity of the path, visible to the traveller but not to us, the little human personage in old-fashioned attire seemed often to be stopped short on the edge of an abyss, the path which he had been following ending there, while, a thousand feet above him in those pine-forests, it was with a melting eye and comforted heart that we saw reappear the threadlike whiteness of its dusty surface, hospitable to the wayfaring foot, whereas from us the side of the mountain had hidden, where it turned to avoid waterfall or gully, the intervening bends

   The effort made by Elstir to strip himself, when face to face with reality, of every intellectual concept, was all the more admirable in that this man who, before sitting down to paint, made himself deliberately ignorant, forgot, in his honesty of purpose, everything that he knew, since what one knows ceases to exist by itself, had in reality an exceptionally cultivated mind. When I confessed to him the disappointment that I had felt upon seeing the porch at Balbec: “What!” he had exclaimed, “you were disappointed by the porch! Why, it’s the finest illustrated Bible that the people have ever had. That Virgin, and all the bas-reliefs telling the story of her life, they are the most loving, the most inspired expression of that endless poem of adoration and praise in which the middle ages extolled the glory of the Madonna. If you only knew, side by side with the most scrupulous accuracy in rendering the sacred text, what exquisite ideas the old carver had, what profound thoughts, what delicious poetry!

    “A wonderful idea, that great sheet in which the angels are carrying the body of the Virgin, too sacred for them to venture to touch it with their hands”; (I mentioned to him that this theme had been treated also at Saint-André-des-Champs; he had seen photographs of the porch there, and agreed, but pointed out that the bustling activity of those little peasant figures, all hurrying at once towards the Virgin, was not the same thing as the gravity of those two great angels, almost Italian, so springing, so gentle) “the angel who is carrying the Virgin’s soul, to reunite it with her body; in the meeting of the Virgin with Elizabeth, Elizabeth’s gestijre when she touches the Virgin’s Womb and marvels to feel that it is great with child; and the bandaged arm of the midwife who had refused, unless she touched, to believe the Immaculate Conception; and the linen cloth thrown by the Virgin to Saint Thomas to give him a proof of the Resurrection; that veil, too, which the Virgin tears from her own bosom to cover the nakedness of her Son, from Whose Side the Church receives in a chalice the Wine of the Sacrament, while, on His other side the Synagogue, whose kingdom is at an end, has its eyes bandaged, holds a half-broken sceptre and lets fall, with the crown that is slipping from its head, the tables of the old law; and the husband who, on the Day of Judgment, as he helps his young wife to rise from her grave, lays her hand against his own heart to reassure her, to prove to her that it is indeed beating, is that such a trumpery idea, do you think, so stale and commonplace? And the angel who is taking away the sun and the moon, henceforth useless, since it is written that the Light of the Cross shall be seven times brighter than the light of the firmament; and the one who is dipping his hand in the water of the Child’s bath, to see whether it is warm enough; and the one emerging from the clouds to place the crown upon the Virgin’s brow, and all the angels who are leaning from the vault of heaven, between the balusters of the New Jerusalem, and throwing up their arms with terror or joy at the sight of the torments of the wicked or the bliss of the elect! For it is all the circles of heaven, a whole gigantic poem full of theology and symbolism that you have before you there. It is fantastic, mad, divine, a thousand times better than anything you will see in Italy, where for that matter this very tympanum has been carefully copied by sculptors with far less genius. There never was a time when genius was universal; that is all nonsense; it would be going beyond the age of gold. The fellow who carved that front, you may make up your mind that he was every bit as great, that he had just as profound ideas as the men you admire most at the present day. I could shew you what I mean if we went there together. There are certain passages from the Office of the Assumption which have been rendered with a subtilty of expression that Redon himself has never equalled.”

   This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which, I understood, had been inscribed there in stone, yet when my eyes, big with desire, had opened to gaze upon the front of Balbec church, it was not these things that I had seen. I spoke to him of those great statues of saints, which, mounted on scaffolds, formed a sort of avenue on either side

    “It starts from the mists of antiquity to end in Jesus Christ,” he explained. “You see on one side His ancestors after the spirit, on the other the Kings of Judah, His ancestors after the flesh. All the ages are there. And if you had looked more closely at what you took for scaffolds you would have been able to give names to the figures standing on them. At the feet of Moses you would have recognised the calf of gold, at Abraham’s the ram and at Joseph’s the demon counselling Potiphar’s wife.”

   I told him also that I had gone there expecting to find an almost Persian building, and that this had doubtless been one of the chief factors in my disappointment. “Indeed, no,” he assured me, “it is perfectly true. Some parts of it are quite oriental; one of the capitals reproduces so exactly a Persian subject that you cannot account for it by the persistence of Oriental traditions. The carver must have copied some casket brought from the East by explorers.” And he did indeed shew me, later on, the photograph of a capital on which I saw dragons that were almost Chinese devouring one another, but at Balbec this little piece of carving had passed unnoticed by me in the general effect of the building which did not conform to the pattern traced in my mind by the words, ‘an almost Persian church.’

   The intellectual pleasures which I enjoyed in this studio did not in the least prevent me from feeling, although they enveloped us as it were in spite of ourselves, the warm polish, the sparkling gloom of the place itself and, through the little window framed in honeysuckle, in the avenue that was quite rustic, the resisting dryness of the sun-parched earth, screened only by the diaphanous gauze woven of distance and of a tree-cast shade. Perhaps the unaccountable feeling of comfort which this summer day was giving me came like a tributary to swell the flood of joy that had surged in me at the sight of Elstir’s Carquethuit Harbour.

   I had supposed Elstir to be a modest man, but I realised my mistake on seeing his face cloud with melancholy when, in a little speech of thanks, I uttered the word ‘fame.’ Men who believe that their work will last — as was the case with Elstir — form the habit of placing that work in a period when they themselves will have crumbled into dust. And thus, by obliging them to reflect on their own extinction, the thought of fame saddens them because it is inseparable from the thought of death. I changed the conversation in the hope of driving away the cloud of ambitious melancholy with which unwittingly I had loaded Elstir’s brow. “Some one advised me once,” I began, thinking of the conversation we had had with Legrandin at Combray, as to which I was glad of an opportunity of learning Elstir’s views, “not to visit Brittany, because it would not be wholesome for a mind with a natural tendency to dream.” “Not at all;” he replied. “When the mind has a tendency to dream, it is a mistake to keep dreams away from it, to ration its dreams. So long as you distract your mind from its dreams, it will not know them for what they are; you will always be being taken in by the appearance of things, because you will not have grasped their true nature. If a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more, to dream all the time. One must have a thorough understanding of one’s dreams if one is not to be troubled by them; there is a way of separating one’s dreams from one’s life which so often produces good results that I ask myself whether one ought not, at all costs, to try it, simply as a preventive, just as certain surgeons make out that we ought, to avoid the risk of appendicitis later on, to have all our appendices taken out when we are children.”

   Elstir and I had meanwhile been walking about the studio, and had reached the window that looked across the garden on to a narrow avenue, a side-street that was almost a country lane. We had gone there to breathe the cooler air of the late afternoon. I supposed myself to be nowhere near the girls of the little band, and it was only by sacrificing for once the hope of seeing them that I had yielded to my grandmother’s prayers and had gone to see Elstir. For where the thing is to be found that we are seeking we never know, and often we steadily, for a long time, avoid the place to which, for quite different reasons, everyone has been asking us to go. But we never suspect that we shall there see the very person of whom we are thinking. I looked out vaguely over the country road which, outside the studio, passed quite close to it but did not belong to Elstir. Suddenly there appeared on it, coming along it at a rapid pace, the young bicyclist of the little band, with, over her dark hair, her polo-cap pulled down towards her plump cheeks, her eyes merry and almost importunate; and on that auspicious path, miraculously filled with promise of delights, I saw her beneath the trees throw to Elstir the smiling greeting of a friend, a rainbow that bridged the gulf for me between our terraqueous world and regions which I had hitherto regarded as inaccessible. She even came up to give her hand to the painter, though without stopping, and I could see that she had a tiny beauty spot on her chin. “Do you know that girl, sir?” I asked Elstir, realising that he could if he chose make me known to her, could invite us both to the house. And this peaceful studio with its rural horizon was at once filled with a surfeit of delight such as a child might feel in a house where he was already happily playing when he learned that, in addition, out of that bounteousness which enables lovely things and noble hosts to increase their gifts beyond all measure, there was being prepared for him a sumptuous repast. Elstir told me that she was called Albertine Simonet, and gave me the names also of her friends, whom I described to him with sufficient accuracy for him to identify them almost without hesitation. I had, with regard to their social position, made a mistake, but not the mistake that I usually made at Balbec. I was always ready to take for princes the sons of shopkeepers when they appeared on horseback. This time I had placed in an interloping class the daughters of a set of respectable people, extremely rich, belonging to the world of industry and business. It was the class which, on first thoughts, interested me least, since it held for me neither the mystery of the lower orders nor that of a society such as the Guermantes frequented. And no doubt if an inherent quality, a rank which they could never forfeit, had not been conferred on them, in my dazzled eyes, by the glaring vacuity of the seaside life all round them, I should perhaps not have succeeded in resisting and overcoming the idea that they were the daughters of prosperous merchants. I could not help marvelling to see how the French middle class was a wonderful studio full of sculpture of the noblest and most varied kind. What unimagined types, what richness of invention in the character of their faces, what firmness, what freshness, what simplicity in their features. The shrewd old moneychangers from whose loins these Dianas and these nymphs had sprung seemed to me to have been the greatest of statuaries. Before I had time to register the social metamorphosis of these girls — so are these discoveries of a mistake, these modifications of the notion one has of a person instantaneous as a chemical combination — there was already installed behind their faces, so street-arab in type that I had taken them for the mistresses of racing bicyclists, of boxing champions, the idea that they might easily be connected with the family of some lawyer or other whom we knew. I was barely conscious of what was meant by Albertine Simonet; she had certainly no conception of what she was one day to mean to me. Even the name, Simonet, which I had already heard spoken on the beach, if I had been asked to write it down I should have spelt with a double ‘n,’ never dreaming of the importance which this family attached to there being but one in their name. In proportion as we descend the social scale our snobbishness fastens on to mere nothings which are perhaps no more null than the distinctions observed by the aristocracy, but, being more obscure, more peculiar to the individual, take us more by surprise. Possibly there had been Simonnets who had done badly in business, or something worse still even. The fact remains that the Simonets never failed, it appeared, to be annoyed if anyone doubled their ‘n.’ They wore the air of being the only Simonets in the world with one ‘n’ instead of two, and were as proud of it, perhaps, as the Montmorency family were of being the premier barons of France. I asked Elstir whether these girls lived at Balbec; yes, he told me, some of them at any rate. The villa in which one of them lived was at that very spot, right at the end of the beach, where the cliffs of Canapville began. As this girl was a great friend of Albertine Simonet, this was another reason for me to believe that it was indeed the latter whom I had met that day when I was with my grandmother. There were of course so many of those little streets running down to the beach, and all at the same angle, that I could not have pointed out exactly which of them it had been. One would like always to remember a thing accurately, but at the time one’s vision was clouded. And yet that Albertine and the girl whom I had seen going to her friend’s house were one and the same person was a practical certainty. In spite of which, whereas the countless images that have since been furnished me by the dark young golfer, however different they may have been from one another, have overlaid one another (because I now know that they all belong to her), and if I retrace the thread of my memories I can, under cover of that identity, and as though along a tunnelled passage, pass through all those images in turn without losing my consciousness of the same person behind them all, if, on the other hand, I wish to revert to the girl whom I passed that day when I was with my grandmother, I must escape first into freer air. I am convinced that it is Albertine whom I find there, the same girl as her who would often stop dead among her moving comrades, in her walk along the foreground of the sea; but all those more recent images remain separate from that earlier one because I am unable to confer on her retrospectively an identity which she had not for me at the moment in which she caught my eye; whatever assurance I may derive from the law of probabilities, that girl with plump cheeks who stared at me so boldly from the angle of the little street and the beach, and by whom I believe that I might have been loved, I have never, in the strict sense of the words, seen again

   My hesitation between the different girls of the little band, all of whom retained something of the collective charm which had at first disturbed me, combined with the reasons already given to allow me later on, even at the time of my greater — my second — passion for Albertine, a sort of intermittent and very brief liberty to abstain from loving her. From having strayed among all her friends before it finally concentrated itself on her, my love kept, now and then, between itself and the image of Albertine a certain ‘play’ of light and shade which enabled it, like a badly fitted lamp, to flit over the surface of each of the others before settling its focus upon her; the connexion between the pain which I felt in my heart and the memory of Albertine did not seem to me necessary; I might perhaps have managed to co-ordinate it with the image of another person, Which enabled me, in a momentary flash, to banish reality altogether, not only external reality, as in my love for Gilberte (which I had recognised to be an internal state in which I drew from myself alone the particular quality, the special character of the person whom I loved, everything that rendered her indispensable to my happiness), but even the other reality, internal and purely subjective

    “Not a day passes but one or the other of them comes by here, and looks in for a minute or two,” Elstir told me, plunging me in despair when I thought that if I had gone to see him at once, when my grandmother had begged me to do so, I should, in all probability, long since have made Albertine’s acquaintance

   She had passed on; from the studio she was no longer in sight. I supposed that she had gone to join her friends on the ‘front.’ Could I have appeared there suddenly with Elstir, I should have got to know them all. I thought of endless pretexts for inducing him to take a turn with me on the beach. I had no longer the same peace of mind as before the apparition of the girl in the frame of the little window; so charming until then in its fringe of honeysuckle, and now so drearily empty. Elstir caused me a joy that was tormenting also when he said that he would go a little way with me, but that he must first finish the piece of work on which he was engaged. It was a flower study but not one of any of the flowers, portraits of which I would rather have commissioned him to paint than the portrait of a person, so that I might learn from the revelation of his genius what I had so often sought in vain from the flowers themselves — hawthorn white and pink, cornflowers, apple-blossom. Elstir as he worked talked botany to me, but I scarcely listened; he was no longer sufficient in himself, he was now only the necessary intermediary between these girls and me; the distinction which, only a few moments ago, his talent had still given him in my eyes was now worthless save in so far as it might confer a little on me also in the eyes of the little band to whom I should be presented by him

   I paced up and down the room, impatient for him to finish what he was doing; I picked up and examined various sketches, any number of which were stacked against the walls. In this way I happened to bring to light a water-colour which evidently belonged to a much earlier period in Elstir’s life, and gave me that particular kind of enchantment which is diffused by works of art not only deliriously executed but representing a subject so singular and so seductive that it is to it that we attribute a great deal of their charm, as if the charm were something that the painter had merely to uncover, to observe, realised already in a material form by nature, and to reproduce in art. That such objects can exist, beautiful quite apart from the painter’s interpretation of them, satisfies a sort of innate materialism in us, against which our reason contends and acts as a counterpoise to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was — this water-colour — the portrait of a young woman, by no means beautiful but of a curious type, in a close-fitting mob-cap not unlike a ‘billy-cock’ hat, trimmed with a ribbon of cherry-coloured silk; in one of her mittened hands was a lighted cigarette, while the other held, level with her knee, a sort of broad-brimmed garden hat, nothing more than a fire screen of plaited straw to keep off the sun. On a table by her side, a tall vase filled with pink carnations. Often (and it was the case here) the singularity of such works is due principally to their having been executed in special conditions for which we do not at first sight make proper allowance, if, for instance, the strange attire of a feminine model is her costume for a masked ball, or conversely the scarlet cloak which an elderly man looks as though he had put on to humour some whim in the painter is his gown as a professor or alderman or his cardinal’s cassock. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait now confronted me arose, without my understanding it, from the fact that she was a young actress of an earlier generation half dressed for a part. But the cap or hat, beneath which the hair stuck out but was cut short, the velvet coat opening without lapels over a white shirt-front, made me hesitate as to the period of the clothes and the sex of the model, so that I did not know what it was exactly that I was holding before my eyes, unless simply the brightest coloured of these scraps of painting. And the pleasure which it afforded me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir, by delaying further, would make me miss the girls, for the sun was now declining and hung low in the little window. Nothing in this water-colour was merely stated there as a fact and painted because of its utility to the composition, the costume because the young woman must be wearing something, the vase to hold the flowers. The glass of the vase, cherished for its own sake, seemed to be holding the water in which the stems of the carnations were dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; the woman’s dress encompassed her in a manner that had an independent, a brotherly charm, and, if the works of man can compete in charm with the wonders of nature, as delicate, as pleasing to the touch of the eye, as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a flower, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the shirt-front, fine as driven rain, with its gay pleats gathered into little bells like lilies of the valley, was starred with bright gleams of light from the room, as sharply edged and as finely shaded as though they had been posies of flowers stitched on the woven lawn. And the velvet of the coat, brilliant with a milky sheen, had here and there a roughness, a scoring, a shagginess on its surface which made one think of the crumpled brightness of the carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, sublimely indifferent to whatever immoral suggestion there might be in this disguise of a young actress for whom the talent with which she would play her part on the stage was doubtless of less importance than the irritant attraction which she would offer to the jaded or depraved senses of some of her audience, had on the contrary fastened upon those ambiguous points as on an aesthetic element which deserved to be brought into prominence, and which he had done everything in his power to emphasise. Along the lines of the face, the latent sex seemed to be on the point of confessing itself to be that of a somewhat boyish girl, then vanished and farther on reappeared with a suggestion rather of an effeminate youth, vicious and pensive, then fled once more to remain uncapturable. The dreamy sadness in the expression of her eyes, by the mere fact of its contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of love-making and play-acting, was not the least disturbing element in the picture. One imagined moreover that it must be feigned, and that the young person who seemed ready to submit to caresses in this provoking costume had probably thought it effective to enhance the provocation with this romantic expression of a secret longing, an unspoken grief. At the foot of the picture was inscribed “Miss Sacripant: October, 1872.” I could not contain my admiration. “Oh, it’s nothing, only a rough sketch I did when I was young; it was a costume for a variety show. It’s all ages ago now.” “And what has become of the model?” A bewilderment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir’s face the indifferent, absent-minded air which, a moment later, he displayed there. “Quick, give it to me!” he cried, “I hear Madame Elstir coming, and, though, I assure you, the young person in the billy-cock hat never played any part in my life, still there’s no point in my wife’s coming in and finding it staring her in the face. I have kept it only as an amusing sidelight on the theatre of those days.” And, before putting it away behind the pile, Elstir, who perhaps had not set eyes on the sketch for years, gave it his careful scrutiny. “I must keep just the head,” he murmured, “the lower part is really too shockingly bad, the hands are a beginner’s work.” I was miserable at the arrival of Mme. Elstir, who could only delay us still further. The window sill was already aglow. Our excursion would be a pure waste of time. There was no longer the slightest chance of our seeing the girls, consequently it mattered now not at all how soon Mme. Elstir left us or how long she stayed. Not that she did stay for any length of time. I found her most tedious; she might have been beautiful, once, at twenty, driving an ox in the Roman Campagna, but her dark hair was streaked with grey and she was common without being simple, because she believed that a pompous manner and majestic attitudes were required by her statuesque beauty, which, however, advancing age had robbed of all its charm. She was dressed with the utmost simplicity. And it was touching, but at the same time surprising to hear Elstir, whenever he opened his mouth, and with a respectful gentleness, as if merely uttering the words moved him to tenderness and veneration, repeat: “My beautiful Gabrielle!” Later on, when I had become familiar with Elstir’s mythological paintings, Mme. Elstir acquired beauty in my eyes also. I understood then that to a certain ideal type illustrated by certain lines, certain arabesques which reappeared incessantly throughout his work, to a certain canon of art he had attributed a character that was almost divine, since the whole of his time, all the mental effort of which he was capable, in a word his whole life he had consecrated to the task of distinguishing those lines as clearly and of reproducing them as faithfully as possible. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was indeed a cult so solemn, so exacting that it never allowed him to be satisfied with what he had achieved; was the most intimate part of himself, and so he had never been able to look at it from a detached standpoint, to extract emotion from it, until the day on which he encountered it realised outside, apart from himself, in the body of a woman, the body of her who in due course became Mme. Elstir and in whom he had been able (as one is able only with something that is not oneself) to find it meritorious, moving, god-like. How comforting, moreover, to let his lips rest upon that Beauty which hitherto he had been obliged with so great labour to extract from ^ within himself, whereas now, mysteriously incarnate, it offered itself to him in a series of communions, filled with saving grace. Elstir at this period was no longer in that early youth in which we look only to the power of our own mind for the realisation of our ideal. He was nearing the age at which we count on bodily satisfactions to stimulate the forces of the brain, at which the exhaustion of the brain inclining us to materialism and the diminution of our activity to the possibility of influences passively received, begin to make us admit that there may indeed be certain bodies, certain callings, certain rhythms that are privileged, realising so naturally our ideal that even without genius, merely by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a throat, we can achieve a masterpiece, it is the age at which we like to caress Beauty with our eyes objectively, outside ourselves, to have it near us, in a tapestry, in a lovely sketch by Titian picked up in a second-hand shop, in a mistress as lovely as Titian’s sketch. When I understood this I could no longer look without pleasure at Mme. Elstir, and her body began to lose its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait by Elstir. She was one for me, and for him also I dare say. The facts of life have no meaning for the artist, they are to him merely an opportunity for exposing the naked blaze of his genius. One feels unmistakably, when one sees side by side ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are all, first and foremost, Elstirs. Only, after this rising tide of genius, which sweeps over and submerges a man’s life, when the brain begins to tire, gradually the balance is upset and, like a river that resumes its course after the counter-flow of a spring tide, it is life that once more takes the upper hand. While the first period lasted, the artist has gradually evolved the law, the formula of his unconscious gift. He knows what situations, should he be a novelist — if a painter, what scenes — furnish him with the subject matter, which may be anything in the world but, whatever it is, is essential to his researches as a laboratory might be of a workshop. He knows that he has created his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, the action of remorse upon consciousness of guilt, out of women posed beneath trees or half-immersed in water, like statues. A day will come when, owing to the exhaustion of his brain, he will no longer have the strength, when provided with those materials which his genius was won't to use, to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will yet continue to seek them out, happy when he finds himself in their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure, the allurement to work that they arouse in him; and, surrounding them besides with a kind of hedge of superstition as if they were superior to all things else, as if in them already dwelt a great part of the work of art which they might be said to carry within them ready made, he will confine himself to the company, to the adoration of his models. He will hold endless conversations with the repentant criminals whose remorse, whose regeneration formed, when he still wrote, the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a district where mists attenuate the light, he will spend long hours gazing at the limbs of bathing women; will collect sumptuous stuffs. And thus the beauty of life, a phase that has to some extent lost its meaning, a stage beyond the boundaries of art at which I had already seen Swann come to rest, was that also which, by a slackening of the creative ardour, idolatry of the forms which had inspired it, desire to avoid effort, must ultimately arrest an Elstir’s progress

   At last he had applied the final brush-stroke to his flowers; I sacrificed a minute to look at them; I acquired no merit by the act, for I knew that there was no chance now of our finding the girls on the beach; and yet, had I believed them to be still there, and that these wasted moments would make me miss them, I should have stopped to look none the less, for I should have told myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with the girls. My grandmother’s nature, a nature that was the exact counterpart of my complete egoism, was nevertheless reflected in certain aspects of my own. In circumstances in which someone to whom I was indifferent, for whom I had always made a show of affection or respect, ran the risk merely of some unpleasantness whereas I was in real danger, I could not have done otherwise than commiserate with him on his annoyance as though it had been something important, and treat my own danger as nothing, because I would feel that these were the proportions in which he must see things. To be quite accurate, I would go even further, and not only not complain of the danger in which I myself stood but go half-way to meet it, and with that which involved other people try, on the contrary, were I to increase the risk of my being caught myself, to avert it from them. The reasons for this are several, none of which does me the slightest credit. One is that if, while only my reason was employed, I have always believed in self-preservation, whenever in the course of my existence I have found myself obsessed by moral anxieties, or merely by nervous scruples, so puerile often that I dare not enumerate them here, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, involving for me the risk of being killed, this new preoccupation was so trivial in comparison with the others that I welcomed it with a sense of relief, almost of hilarity. Thus I find myself, albeit the least courageous of men, to have known that feeling which has always seemed to me, in my reasoning moods, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even although I were, when any, even a deadly peril threatened me, passing through an entirely calm and happy phase, I could not, were I with another person, refrain from sheltering him behind me and choosing for myself the post of danger. When a sufficient store of experience had taught me that I invariably acted, and enjoyed acting, thus, I discovered — and was deeply ashamed by the discovery — that it was because, in contradiction of what I had always believed and asserted, I was extremely sensitive to the opinions of others. Not that this kind of unconfessed self-esteem is in any sense vanity or conceit. For what might satisfy one or other of those failings would give me no pleasure, and I have always refrained from indulging them. But with the people in whose company I have succeeded in concealing most effectively the slight advantages a knowledge of which might have given them a less derogatory idea of myself, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of shewing them that I take more trouble to avert the risk of death from their path than from my own. As my motive is then self-esteem and not valour, I find it quite natural that in any crisis they should act differently. I am far from blaming them for it, as I should perhaps if I had been moved by a sense of duty, a duty which would seem to me, in that case, to be as incumbent upon them as upon myself. On the contrary, I feel that it is eminently sensible of them to safeguard their lives, though at the same time I cannot prevent my own safety from receding into the background, which is particularly silly and culpable of me since I have come to realise that the lives of many of the people in front of whom I plant myself when a bomb bursts are more valueless even than my own. However, on the day of this first visit to Elstir, the time was still distant at which I was to become conscious of this difference in value, and there was no question of danger, but simply — a harbinger this of that pernicious self-esteem — the question of my not appearing to attach to the pleasure which I so ardently desired more importance than to the work which the painter had still to finish. It was finished at last. And, once we were out of doors, I discovered that — so long were the days still at this season — it was not so late as I had supposed; we strolled down to the ‘front.’ What stratagems I employed to keep Elstir standing at the spot where I thought that the girls might still come past. Pointing to the cliffs that towered beside us, I kept on asking him to tell me about them, so as to make him forget the time and stay there a little longer. I felt that we had a better chance of waylaying the little band if we moved towards the end of the beach. “I should like to look at those cliffs with you from a little nearer,” I said to him, having noticed that one of the girls was in the habit of going in that direction. “And as we go, do tell me about Carquethuit. I should so like to see Carquethuit,” I went on, without thinking that the so novel character which manifested itself with such force m Elstir’sCarquethuit Harbour, might belong perhaps rather to the painter’s vision than to any special quality in the place itself. “Since I’ve seen your picture, I think that is where I should most like to go, there and to the Pointe du Raz, but of course that would be quite a journey from here.” “Yes, and besides, even if it weren’t nearer, I should advise you perhaps all the same to visit Carquethuit,” he replied. “The Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but after all it is simply the high cliff of Normandy or Brittany which you know already. Carquethuit is quite different, with those rocks bursting from a level shore. I know nothing in France like it, it reminds me rather of what one sees in some parts of Florida. It is most interesting, and for that matter extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme; you know how desolate those parts are; the sweep of the coast-line is delicious. Here, the coast-line is like anywhere else; but along there I can’t tell you what charm it has, what softness.”

   Night was falling; it was time to be turning homewards; I was escorting Elstir in the direction of his villa when suddenly, as it were Mephistopheles springing up before Faust, there appeared at the end of the avenue — like simply an objectification, unreal, diabolical, of the temperament diametrically opposed to my own, of the semi-barbarous and cruel vitality of which I, in my weakness, my excess of tortured sensibility and intellectuality was so destitute — a few spots of the essence impossible to mistake for anything else in the world, a few spores of the zoophytic band of girls, who wore an air of not having seen me but were unquestionably, for all that, proceeding as they advanced to pass judgment on me in their ironic vein. Feeling that a collision between them and us was now inevitable, and that Elstir would be certain to call me, I turned my back, like a bather preparing to meet the shock of a wave; I stopped dead and, leaving my eminent companion to pursue his way, remained where I was, stooping, as if I had suddenly become engrossed in it, towards the window of the curiosity shop which we happened to be passing at the moment. I was not sorry to give the appearance of being able to think of something other than these girls, and I was already dimly aware that when Elstir did call me up to introduce me to them I should wear that sort of challenging expression which betokens not surprise but the wish to appear as though one were surprised — so far is every one of us a bad actor, or everyone else a good thought-reader; — that I should even go so far as to point a finger to my breast, as who should ask “It is me, really, that you want?” and then run to join him, my head lowered in compliance and docility and my face coldly masking my annoyance at being torn from the study of old pottery in order to be introduced to people whom I had no wish to know. Meanwhile I explored the window and waited for the moment in which my name, shouted by Elstir, would come to strike me like an expected and innocuous bullet. The certainty of being introduced to these girls had had the result of making me not only feign complete indifference to them, but actually to feel it. Inevitable from this point, the pleasure of knowing them began at once to shrink, became less to me than the pleasure of talking to Saint-Loup, of dining with my grandmother, of making, in the neighbourhood of Balbec, excursions which I would regret the probability, in consequence of my having to associate with people who could scarcely be much interested in old buildings, of my being forced to abandon. Moreover, what diminished the pleasure which I was about to feel was not merely the imminence but the incoherence of its realisation. Laws as precise as those of hydrostatics maintain the relative position of the images which we form in a fixed order, which the coming event at once upsets. Elstir was just about to call me. This was not at all the fashion in which I had so often, on the beach, in my bedroom, imagined myself making these girls’ acquaintance. What was about to happen was a different event, for which I was not prepared. I recognised neither my desire nor its object; I regretted almost that I had come out with Elstir. But, above all, the shrinking of the pleasure that I expected to feel was due to the certainty that nothing, now, could take that pleasure from me. And it resumed, as though by some latent elasticity in itself, its whole extent when it ceased to be subjected to the pressure of that certainty, at the moment when, having decided to turn my head, I saw Elstir, standing where he had stopped a few feet away with the girls, bidding them good-bye. The face of the girl who stood nearest to him, round and plump and glittering with the light in her eyes, reminded me of a cake on the top of which a place has been kept for a morsel of blue sky. Her eyes, even when fixed on an object, gave one the impression of motion, just as on days of high wind the air, although invisible, lets us perceive the speed with which it courses between us and the unchanging azure. For a moment her gaze intersected mine, like those travelling skies on stormy days which hurry after a rain-cloud that moves less rapidly than they, overtake, touch, cover, pass it and are gone; but they do not know one another, and are soon driven far apart. So our eyes were for a moment confronted, neither pair knowing what the celestial continent that lay before their gaze held of future blessing or disaster. Only at the moment when her gaze was directly coincident with mine, without slackening its movement it grew perceptibly duller. So on a starry night the wind-swept moon passes behind a cloud and veils her brightness for a moment, but soon will shine again. But Elstir had already said goodbye to the girls, and had never summoned me. They disappeared down a cross street; he came towards me. My whole plan was spoiled

   I have said that Albertine had not seemed to me that day to be the same as on previous days and that afterwards, each time I saw her, she was to appear different. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the appearance, the importance, the stature of a person may also be due to the variability of certain states of consciousness interposed between that person and us. One of those that play an important part in such transformations is belief; that evening my belief, then the vanishing of my belief, that I was about to know Albertine had, with a few seconds’ interval only, rendered her almost insignificant, then infinitely precious in my sight; some years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief, that Albertine was faithful to me brought about similar changes

   Of course, long ago, at Combfay, I had seen shrink or stretch, according to the time of day, according as I was entering one or the other of the two dominant moods that governed my sensibility in turn, my grief at not having my mother with me, as imperceptible all afternoon as is the moon’s light when the sun is shining, and then, when night had come, reigning alone in my anxious heart in the place of recent memories now obliterated. But on that day at Balbec, when I saw that Elstir was leaving the girls and had not called me, I learned for the first time that the variations in the importance which a pleasure or a pain has in our eyes may depend not merely on this alternation of two moods, but on the displacement of invisible beliefs, such, for example, as make death seem to us of no account because they bathe it in a glow of unreality, and thus enable us to attach importance to our attending an evening party, which would lose much of its charm for if, on the announcement that we were sentenced to die by the guillotine, the belief that had bathed the party in its warm glow was instantly shattered; and this part that belief plays, it is true that something in me was aware of it; this was my will; but its knowledge is vain if the mind, the heart continue in ignorance; these last act in good faith when they believe that we are anxious to forsake a mistress to whom our will alone knows that we are still attached. This is because they are clouded by the belief that we shall see her again at any moment. But let this belief be shattered, let them suddenly become aware that this mistress is gone from us for ever, then the mind and heart, having lost their focus, are driven like mad things, the meanest pleasure becomes infinitely great

   Variance of a belief, annulment also of love, which, pre-existent and mobile, comes to rest at the image of any one woman simply because that woman will be almost impossible of attainment. Thenceforward we think not so much of the woman of whom we find difficult in forming an exact picture, as of the means of getting to know her. A whole series of agonies develops and is sufficient to fix our love definitely upon her who is its almost unknown object. Our love becomes immense; we never dream how small a place in it the real woman occupies. And if suddenly, as at the moment when I had seen Elstir stop to talk to the girls, we cease to be uneasy, to suffer pain, since it is this pain that is the whole of our love, it seems to us as though love had abruptly vanished at the moment when at length we grasp the prey to whose value we had not given enough thought before. What did I know of Albertine? One or two glimpses of a profile against the sea, less beautiful, assuredly, than those of Veronese’s women whom I ought, had I been guided by purely aesthetic reasons, to have preferred to her. By what other reasons could I be guided, since, my anxiety having subsided, I could recapture only those mute profiles; I possessed nothing of her besides. Since my first sight of Albertine I had meditated upon her daily, a thousandfold, I had carried on with what I called by her name an interminable unspoken dialogue in which I made her question me, answer me, think and act, and in the infinite series of imaginary Albertines who followed one after the other in my fancy, hour after hour, the real Albertine, a glimpse caught on the beach, figured only at the head, just as the actress who creates a part, the star, appears, out of a long series of performances, in the few first alone. That Albertine was scarcely more than a silhouette, all that was superimposed being of my own growth, so far when we are in love does the contribution that we ourself make outweigh — even if we consider quantity only — those that come to us from the beloved object. And the same is true of love that is given its full effect. There are loves that manage not only to be formed but to subsist around a very little core — even among those whose prayer has been answered after the flesh. An old drawing-master who had taught my grandmother had been presented by some obscure mistress with a daughter. The mother died shortly after the birth of her child, and the drawing-master was so broken-hearted that he did not long survive her. In the last months of his life my grandmother and some of the Combray ladies, who had never liked to make any allusion in the drawing-master’s presence to the woman, with whom, for that matter, he had not officially ‘lived’ and had had comparatively slight relations, took it into their heads to ensure the little girl’s future by combining to purchase an annuity for her. It was my grandmother who suggested this; several of her friends made difficulties; after all was the child really such a very interesting case, was she even the child of her reputed father; with women like that, it was never safe to say. Finally, everything was settled. The child came to thank the ladies. She was plain, and so absurdly like the old drawing-master as to remove every shadow of doubt; her hair being the only nice thing about her, one of the ladies said to her father, who had come with her: “What pretty hair she has.” And thinking that now, the woman who had sinned being dead and the old man only half alive, a discreet allusion to that past of which they had always pretended to know nothing could do no harm, my grandmother added: “It runs in families. Did her mother have pretty hair like that?” “I don’t know,” was the old man’s quaint answer. “I never saw her except with a hat on.”

   But I must not keep Elstir waiting. I caught sight of myself in a glass. To add to the disaster of my not having been introduced to the girls, I noticed that my necktie was all crooked, my hat left long wisps of hair shewing, which did not become me; but it was a piece of luck, all the same, that they should have seen me, even thus attired, in Elstir’s company and so could not forget me; also that I should have put on, that morning, at my grandmother’s suggestion, my smart waistcoat, when I might so easily have been wearing one that was simply hideous, and be carrying my best stick. For while an event for which we are longing never happens quite in the way we have been expecting, failing the advantages on which we supposed that we might count, others present themselves for which we never hoped, and make up for our disappointment; and we have been so dreading the worst that in the end we are inclined to feel that, taking one thing with another, chance has, on the whole, been rather kind to us

    “I did so much want to know them,” I said as I reached Elstir. “Then why did you stand a mile away?” These were his actual words, not that they expressed what was in his mind, since, if his desire had been to grant mine, to call me up to him would have been quite easy, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this sort, in familiar use among common people when they are in the wrong, and because even great men are in certain respects much the same as common people, take their everyday excuses from the same common stock just as they get their daily bread from the same baker; or it may be that such expressions (which ought, one might almost say, to be read ‘backwards,’ since their literal interpretation is the opposite of the truth) are the instantaneous effect, the negative exposure of a reflex action. “They were in a hurry.” It struck me that of course they must have stopped him from summoning a person who did not greatly attract them; otherwise he would not have failed, after all the questions that I had put to him about them, and the interest which he must have seen that I took in them, to call me. “We were speaking just now of Carquethuit,” he began, as we walked towards his villa. “I have done a little sketch, in which you can see much better how the beach curves. The painting is not bad, but it is different. If you will allow me, just to cement our friendship, I would like to give you the sketch,” he went on, for the people who refuse us the objects of our desire are always ready to offer us something else

    “I should very much like, if you have such a thing, a photograph of the little picture of Miss Sacripant. ‘Sacripant’— that’s not a real name, surely?” “It is the name of a character the sitter played in a stupid little musical comedy.” “But, I assure you, sir, I have never set eyes on her; you look as though you thought that I knew her.” Elstir was silent. “It isn’t Mme. Swann, before she was married?” I hazarded, in one of those sudden fortuitous stumblings upon the truth, which are rare enough in all conscience, and yet give, in the long run, a certain cumulative support to the theory of presentiments, provided that one takes care to forget all the wrong guesses that would invalidate it. Elstir did not reply. The portrait was indeed that of Odette de Crécy. She had preferred not to keep it for many reasons, some of them obvious. But there were others less apparent. The portrait dated from before the point at which Odette, disciplining her features, had made of her face and figure that creation the broad outlines of which her hairdressers, her dressmakers, she herself — in her way of standing, of speaking, of smiling, of moving her hands, her eyes, of thinking — were to respect throughout the years to come. It required the vitiated tastes of a surfeited lover to make Swann prefer to all the countless photographs of the ‘sealed pattern’ Odette which was his charming wife the little photographs which he kept in his room and in which, beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies, you saw a thin young woman, not even good-looking, with bunched-out hair and drawn features

   But apart from this, had the portrait been not anterior like Swann’s favourite photograph, to the systématisation of Odette’s features in a fresh type, majestic and charming, but subsequent to it, Elstir’s vision would alone have sufficed to disorganise that type. Artistic genius in its reactions is like those extremely high temperatures which have the power to disintegrate combinations of atoms which they proceed to combine afresh in a diametrically opposite order, following another type. All that artificially harmonious whole into which a woman has succeeded in bringing her limbs and features, the persistence of which every day, before going out, she studies in her glass, changing the angle of her hat, smoothing her hair, exercising the sprightliness in her eyes, so as to ensure its continuity, that harmony the keen eye of the great painter instantly destroys, substituting for it a rearrangement of the woman’s features such as will satisfy a certain pictorial ideal of femininity which he carries in his head. Similarly it often happens that, after a certain age, the eye of a great seeker after truth will find everywhere the elements necessary to establish those relations which alone are of interest to him. Like those craftsmen, those players who, instead of making a fuss and asking for what they cannot have, content themselves with the instrument that comes to their hand, the artist might say of anything, no matter what, that it would serve his purpose. Thus a cousin of the Princesse de Luxembourg, a beauty of the most queenly type, having succumbed to a form of art which was new at that time, had asked the leading painter of the naturalist school to do her portrait. At once the artist’s eye had found what he sought everywhere in life. And on his canvas there appeared, in place of the proud lady, a street-boy, and behind him a vast, sloping, purple background which made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going so far as that, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not seek in the least to give satisfaction to various demands on the woman’s part — such as for instance, when she begins to age, make her have herself photographed in dresses that are almost those of a young girl, which bring out her still youthful figure and make her appear like the sister, or even the daughter of her own daughter, who, if need be, is tricked out for the occasion as a ‘perfect fright’ by her side — it will, on the contrary, emphasise those very drawbacks which she seeks to hide, and which (as for instance a feverish, that is to say a livid complexion) are all the more tempting to him since they give his picture ‘character’; they are quite enough, however, to destroy all the illusions of the ordinary man who, when he sees the picture, sees crumble into dust the ideal which the woman herself has so proudly sustained for him, which has placed her in her unique, her unalterable form so far apart, so far above the rest of humanity. Fallen now, represented otherwise than in her own type in which she sat unassailably enthroned, she is become nothing more than just an ordinary woman, in the legend of whose superiority we have lost all faith. In this type we are so accustomed to regard as included not only the beauty of an Odette but her personality, her identity, that standing before the portrait which has thus transposed her from it we are inclined to protest not simply “How plain he has made her!” but “Why, it isn’t the least bit like her!” We find it hard to believe that it can be she. We do not recognise her. And yet there is a person there on the canvas whom we are quite conscious of having seen before. But that person is not Odette; the face of the person, her body, her general appearance seem familiar. They recall to us not this particular woman who never held herself like that, whose natural pose had no suggestion of any such strange and teasing arabesque in its outlines, but other women, all the women whom Elstir has ever painted, women whom invariably, however they may differ from one another, he has chosen to plant thus on his canvas facing you, with an arched foot thrust out from under the skirt, a large round hat in one hand, symmetrically corresponding at the level of the knee which it hides to what also appears as a disc, higher up in the picture: the face. And furthermore, not only does a portrait by the hand of genius disintegrate and destroy a woman’s type, as it has been denned by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is also old, it is not content with ageing the original in the same way as a photograph ages its sitter, by shewing her dressed in the fashions of long ago. In a portrait, it is not only the manner the woman then had of dressing that dates it, there is also the manner the artist had of painting. And this, Elstir’s earliest manner, was the most damaging of birth certificates for Odette because it not only established her, as did her photographs of the same period, as the younger sister of various time-honoured courtesans, but made her portrait contemporary with the countless portraits that Manet or Whistler had painted of all those vanished models, models who already belonged to oblivion or to history

   It was along this train of thought, meditated in silence by the side of Elstir as I accompanied him to his door, that I was being led by the discovery that I had just made of the identity of his model, when this original discovery caused me to make a second, more disturbing still, involving the identity of the artist. He had painted the portrait of Odette de Crécy. Could it possibly be that this man of genius, this sage, this eremite, this philosopher with his marvellous flow of conversation, who towered over everyone and everything, was the foolish, corrupt little painter who had at one time been ‘taken up’ by the Verdurins? I asked him if he had known them, whether by any chance it was he that they used to call M. Biche. He answered me in the affirmative, with no trace of embarrassment, as if my question referred to a period in his life that was ended and already somewhat remote, with no suspicion of what a cherished illusion his words were shattering in me, until looking up he read my disappointment upon my face. His own assumed an expression of annoyance. And, as we were now almost at the gate of his house, a man of less outstanding eminence, in heart and brain, might simply have said ‘good-bye’ to me, a trifle dryly, and taken care to avoid seeing me again. This however was not Elstir’s way with me; like the master that he was — and this was, perhaps, from the point of view of sheer creative genius, his one fault, that he was a master in that sense of the word, for an artist if he is to live the true life of the spirit in its full extent, must be alone and not bestow himself with profusion, even upon disciples — from every circumstance, whether involving himself or other people, he sought to extract, for the better edification of the young, the element of truth that it contained. He chose therefore, rather than say anything that might have avenged the injury to his pride, to say what he thought would prove instructive to me. “There is no man,” he began, “however wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or lived in a way the consciousness of which is so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory. And yet he ought not entirely to regret it, because he cannot be certain that he has indeed become a wise man — so far as it is possible for any of us to be wise — unless he has passed through all the fatuous or unwholesome incarnations by which that ultimate stage must be preceded. I know that there are young fellows, the sons and grandsons of famous men, whose masters have instilled into them nobility of mind and moral refinement in their schooldays. They have, perhaps, when they look back upon their past lives, nothing to retract; they can, if they choose, publish a signed account of everything they have ever said or done; but they are poor creatures, feeble descendants of doctrinaires, and their wisdom is negative and sterile. We are not provided with wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can take for us, an effort which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you are not the result of training at home, by a father, or by masters at school, they have sprung from beginnings of a very different order, by reaction from the influence of everything evil or commonplace that prevailed round about them. They represent a struggle and a victory. I can see that the picture of what we once were, in early youth, may not be recognisable and cannot, certainly, be pleasing to contemplate in later life. But we must not deny the truth of it, for it is evidence that we have really lived, that it is in accordance with the laws of life and of the mind that we have, from the common elements of life, of the life of studios, of artistic groups — assuming that one is a painter — extracted something that goes beyond them.” Meanwhile we had reached his door. I was disappointed at not having met the girls. But after all there was now the possibility of meeting them again later on; they had ceased to do no more than pass beyond a horizon on which I had been ready to suppose that I should never see them reappear. Around them no longer swirled that sort of great eddy which had separated me from them, which had been merely the expression of the perpetually active desire, mobile, compelling, fed ever on fresh anxieties, which was aroused in me by their inaccessibility, their flight from me, possibly for ever. My desire for them, I could now set it at rest, hold it in reserve, among all those other desires the realisation of which, as soon as I knew it to be possible, I would cheerfully postpone. I took leave of Elstir; I was alone once again. Then all of a sudden, despite my recent disappointment, I saw in my mind’s eye all that chain of coincidence which I had not supposed could possibly come about, that Elstir should be a friend of those very girls, that they who only that morning had been to me merely figures in a picture with the sea for background had seen me, had seen me walking in friendly intimacy with a great painter, who was now informed of my secret longing and would no doubt do what he could to assuage it. All this had been a source of pleasure to me, but that pleasure had remained hidden; it was one of those visitors who wait before letting us know that they are in the room until all the rest have gone and we are by ourselves. Then only do we catch sight of them, and can say to them, “I am at your service,” and listen to what they have to tell us. Sometimes between the moment at which these pleasures have entered our consciousness and the moment at which we are free to entertain them, so many hours have passed, we have in the interval seen so many people that we are afraid lest they should have grown tired of waiting. But they are patient, they do not grow tired, and as soon as the crowd has gone we find them there ready for us. Sometimes it is then we who are so exhausted that it seems as though our weary mind will not have the strength left to seize and retain those memories, those impressions for which our frail self is the one habitable place, the sole means of realisation. And we should regret that failure, for existence to us is hardly interesting save on the days on which the dust of realities is shot with magic sand, on which some trivial incident of life becomes a spring of romance. Then a whole promontory of the inaccessible world rises clear in the light of our dream, and enters into our life, our life in which, like the sleeper awakened, we actually see the people of whom we have been so ardently dreaming that we came to believe that we should never behold them save in our dreams

   The sense of comfort that I drew from the probability of my now being able to meet the little band whenever I chose was all the more precious to me because I should not have been able to keep watch for them during the next few days, which would be taken up with preparations for Saint-Loup’s departure. My grandmother was anxious to offer my friend some proof of her gratitude for all the kindnesses that he had shewn to her and myself. I told her that he was a great admirer of Proudhon, and this put it into her head to send for a collection of autograph letters by that philosopher which she had once bought; Saint-Loup came to her room to look at them on the day of their arrival, which was also his last day at Balbec. He read them eagerly, fingering each page with reverence, trying to get the sentences by heart; and then, rising from the table, was beginning to apologise to my grandmother for having stayed so long, when he heard her say: “No, no; take them with you; they are for you to keep; that was why I sent for them, to give them to you.”

   He was overpowered by a joy which he could no more control than we can a physical condition that arises without the intervention of our will. He blushed scarlet as a child who has just been whipped, and my grandmother was a great deal more touched to see all the efforts that he was making (without success) to control the joy that convulsed him than she would have been to hear any words of thanks that he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had failed to shew his gratitude properly, begged me to make his excuses to her again, next day, leaning from the window of the little train of the local railway company which was to take him back to his regiment. The distance was, as a matter of fact, nothing. He had thought of going, as he had frequently done that summer, when he was to return the same evening and was not encumbered with luggage, by road. But this time he would have had, anyhow, to put all his heavy luggage in the train. And he found it simpler to take the train himself also, following the advice of the manager who, on being consulted, replied that “Carriage or train, it was more or less equivocal.” He meant us to understand that they were equivalent (in fact, very much what Françoise would have expressed as “coming to as near as made no difference”). “Very well,” Saint-Loup had decided, “I will take the ‘little crawler.’” I should have taken it too, had I not been tired, and gone with my friend to Doncières; failing this I kept on promising, all the time that we waited in the Balbec station — the time, that is to say, which the driver of the little train spent in waiting for unpunctual friends, without whom he refused to start, and also in seeking some refreshment for himself — to go over there and see him several times a week. As Bloch had come to the station also — much to Saint-Loup’s disgust — the latter, seeing that our companion could hear him begging me to come to luncheon, to dinner, to stay altogether at Doncières, finally turned to him and, in the most forbidding tone, intended to counteract the forced civility of the invitation and to prevent Bloch from taking it seriously: “If you ever happen to be passing through Doncières any afternoon when I am off duty, you might ask for me at the barracks; but I hardly ever am off duty.” Perhaps, also, Robert feared lest, if left to myself, I might not come, and, thinking that I was more intimate with Bloch than I made out, was providing me in this way with a travelling companion, one who would urge me on

   I was afraid that this tone, this way of inviting a person while warning him not to come, might have wounded Bloch, and felt that Saint-Loup would have done better, saying nothing. But I was mistaken, for after the train had gone, while we were walking back together as far as the crossroads at which we should have to part, one road going to the hotel, the other to the Blochs’ villa, he never ceased from asking me on what day we should go to Doncières, for after “all the civilities that Saint-Loup had shewn” him, it would be ‘too unmannerly’ on his part not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had not noticed, or was so little displeased as to wish to let it be thought that he had not noticed on how far from pressing, how barely polite a note the invitation had been sounded. At the same time I should have liked Bloch, for his own sake, to refrain from making a fool of himself by going over at once to Doncières. But I dared not offer a piece of advice which could only have offended him by hinting that Saint-Loup had been less pressing than himself impressed. He was a great deal too ready to respond, and even if all his faults of this nature were atoned for by remarkable qualities which others, with more reserve than he, would not possess, he carried indiscretion to a pitch that was almost maddening. The week must not, to hear him speak, pass without our going to Doncières (he said ‘our’ for I think that he counted to some extent on my presence there as an excuse for his own). All the way home, opposite the gymnasium, in its grove of trees, opposite the lawn-tennis courts, the mayor’s office, the shell-fish stall, he stopped me, imploring me to fix a day, and, as I did not, left me in a towering rage, saying: “As your lordship pleases. For my part, I’m obliged to go since he has invited me.”

   Saint-Loup was still so much afraid of not having thanked my grandmother properly that he charged me once again to express his gratitude to her a day or two later in a letter I received from him from the town in which he was quartered, a town which seemed, on the envelope where the post-mark had stamped its name, to be hastening to me across country, to tell me that within its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was embossed with the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion, surmounted by a coronet formed by the cap of a Peer of France

    “After a journey which,” he wrote, “passed pleasantly enough, with a book I bought at the station, by Arvède Barine (a Russian author, I fancy; it seemed to me remarkably well written for a foreigner, but you shall give me your critical opinion, you are bound to know all about it, you fount of knowledge who have read everything), here I am again in the thick of this debased existence, where, alas, I feel a sad exile, not having here what I had to leave at Balbec; this life in which I cannot discover one affectionate memory, any intellectual attraction; an environment on which you would probably look with contempt — and yet it has a certain charm. Everything seems to have changed since I was last here, for in the interval one of the most important periods in my life, that from which our friendship dates, has begun. I hope that it may never come to an end. I have spoken of our friendship, of you, to one person only, to the friend I told you of, who has just paid me a surprise visit here. She would like immensely to know you, and I feel that you would get on well together, for she too is extremely literary. I, on the other hand, to go over in my mind all our talk, to live over again those hours which I never shall forget, have shut myself off from my comrades, excellent fellows, but altogether incapable of understanding that sort of thing. This remembrance of moments spent with you I should almost have preferred, on my first day here, to call up for my own solitary enjoyment, without writing. But I was afraid lest you, with your subtle mind and ultra-sensitive heart, might, if you did not hear from me, needlessly torment yourself, if, that is to say, you still condescend to occupy your thoughts with this blunt trooper whom you will have a hard task to polish and refine, and make a little more subtle and worthier of your company.”

   On the whole this letter, in its affectionate spirit, was not at all unlike those which, when I did not yet know Saint-Loup, I had imagined that he would write to me, in those daydreams from which the coldness of his first greeting had shaken me by bringing me face to face with an icy reality which was not, however, to endure. Once I had received this letter, whenever, at luncheon-time, the post was brought in, I could tell at once when it was from him that a letter came, for it had always that second face which a person assumes when he is absent, in the features of which (the characters of his script) there is no reason why we should not suppose that we are tracing an individual soul just as much as in the line of a nose or the inflexions of a voice

   I would now gladly remain at the table while it was being cleared, and, if it was not a moment at which the girls of the little band might be passing, it was no longer solely towards the sea that I would turn my eyes. Since I had seen such things depicted in water-colours by Elstir, I sought to find again in reality, I cherished, as though for their poetic beauty, the broken gestures of the knives still lying across one another, the swollen convexity of a discarded napkin upon which the sun would patch a scrap of yellow velvet, the half-empty glass which thus shewed to greater advantage the noble sweep of its curved sides, and, in the heart of its translucent crystal, clear as frozen daylight, a dreg of wine, dusky but sparkling with reflected lights, the displacement of solid objects, the transmutation of liquids by the effect of light and shade, the shifting colour of the plums which passed from green to blue and from blue to golden yellow in the half-plundered dish, the chairs, like a group of old ladies, that came twice daily to take their places round the white cloth spread on the table as on an altar at which were celebrated the rites of the palate, where in the hollows of oyster-shells a few drops of lustral water had gathered as in tiny holy water stoups of stone; I tried to find beauty there where I had never imagined before that it could exist, in the most ordinary things, in the profundities of ‘still life.’

   When, some days after Saint-Loup’s departure, I had succeeded in persuading Elstir to give a small tea-party, at which I was to meet Albertine, that freshness of appearance, that smartness of attire, both (alas) fleeting, which were to be observed in me at the moment of my starting out from the Grand Hotel, and were due respectively to a longer rest than usual and to special pains over my toilet, I regretted my inability to reserve them (and also the credit accruing from Elstir’s friendship) for the captivation of some other, more interesting person; I regretted having to use them all up on the simple pleasure of making Albertine’s acquaintance. My brain assessed this pleasure at a very low value now that it was assured me. But, inside, my will did not for a moment share this illusion, that will which is the persevering and unalterable servant of our successive personalities; hiding itself in secret places, despised, downtrodden, untiringly faithful, toiling without intermission and with no thought for the variability of the self, its master, if only that master may never lack what he requires. Whereas at the moment when we are just about to start on a long-planned and eagerly awaited holiday, our brain, our nerves begin to ask themselves whether it is really worth all the trouble involved, the will, knowing that those lazy masters would at once begin to consider their journey the most wonderful experience, if it became impossible for them to take it, the will leaves them explaining their difficulties outside the station, multiplying their hesitations; but busies itself with taking the tickets and putting us into the carriage before the train starts. It is as invariable as brain and nerves are fickle, but as it is silent, gives no account of its actions, it seems almost non-existent; it is by its dogged determination that the other constituent parts of our personality are led, but without seeing it, while they distinguish clearly all their own uncertainties. My nerves and brain then started a discussion as to the real value of the pleasure that there would be in knowing Albertine, while I studied in the glass vain and perishable attractions which nerves and brain would have preserved intact for use on some other occasion. But my will would not let the hour pass at which I must start, and ‘it was Elstir’s address that it called out to the driver. Brain and nerves were at liberty, now that the die was cast, to think this ‘a pity.’ If my will had given the man a different address, they would have been finely ‘sold.’

   When I arrived at Elstir’s, a few minutes later, my first impression was that Mlle. Simonet was not in the studio. There was certainly a girl sitting there in a silk frock, bareheaded, but one whose marvellous hair, whose nose, meant nothing to me, in whom I did not recognise the human entity that I had formed out of a young cyclist strolling past, in a polo-cap, between myself and the sea. It was Albertine, nevertheless. But even when I knew it to be she, I gave her no thought. On entering any social gathering, when we are young, we lose consciousness of our old self, we become a different man, every drawing-room being a fresh universe, in which, coming under the sway of a new moral perspective, we fasten our attention, as if they were to matter to us for all time, on people, dances, card-tables, all of which we shall have forgotten by the morning. Obliged to follow, if I was to arrive at the goal of conversation with Albertine, a road in no way of my own planning, which first brought me to a halt at Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was presented, then along the table, at which I was offered, and ate, a strawberry tart or two, while I listened, motionless, to the music that was beginning in another part of the room, I found myself giving to these various incidents the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle. Simonet, an introduction which was now nothing more than one among several such incidents, having entirely forgotten that it had been, but a few minutes since, my sole object in coming there that day. But is it not ever thus in the bustle of daily life, with every true happiness, every great sorrow? In a room full of other people we receive from her whom we love the answer, propitious or fatal, which we have been awaiting for the last year. But we must go on talking, ideas come, one after another, forming a smooth surface which is pricked, at the very most, now and then by a dull throb from within of the memory, deep-rooted enough but of very slender growth, that misfortune has come upon us. If, instead of misfortune, it is happiness, it may be that not until many years have elapsed will we recall that the most important event in our sentimental life occurred without our having time to give it any prolonged attention, or even to become aware of it almost, at a social gathering, it may have been, to which we had gone solely in expectation of that event

   When Elstir asked me to come with him so that he might introduce me to Albertine, who was sitting a little farther down the room, I first of all finished eating a coffee éclair and, with a show of keen interest, asked an old gentleman whose acquaintance I had just made (and thought that I might, perhaps, offer him the rose in my buttonhole which he had admired) to tell me more about the old Norman fairs. This is not to say that the introduction which followed did not give me any pleasure, nor assume a definite importance in my eyes. But so far as the pleasure was concerned, I was not conscious of it, naturally, until some time later, when, once more in the hotel, and in my room alone, I had become myself again. Pleasure in this respect is like photography. What we take, in the presence of the beloved object, is merely a negative film; we develop it later, when we are at home, and have once again found at our disposal that inner darkroom, the entrance to which is barred to us so long as we are with other people

   If my consciousness of the pleasure it had brought me was thus retarded by a few hours, the importance of this introduction I felt immediately. At such moments of introduction, for all that we feel ourselves to have been suddenly enriched, to have been furnished with a pass that will admit us henceforward to pleasures which we have been pursuing for weeks past, but in vain, we realise only too clearly that this acquisition puts an end for us not merely to hours of toilsome search — a relief that could only fill us with joy — but also to the very existence of a certain person, her whom our imagination had wildly distorted, our anxious fear that we might never become known to her enlarged. At the moment when our name sounds on the lips of the person introducing us, especially if he amplifies it, as Elstir was now doing, with a flattering account of us — in that sacramental moment, as when in a fairy tale the magician commands a person suddenly to become someone else, she to whose presence we have been longing to attain vanishes; how could she remain the same when, for one thing — owing to the attention which the stranger is obliged to pay to the announcement of our name and the sight of our person — in the eyes that only yesterday were situated at an infinite distance (where we supposed that our eyes, wandering, uncontrolled, desperate, divergent, would never succeed in meeting them) the conscious gaze, the incommunicable thought which we have been seeking have been miraculously and quite simply replaced by our own image, painted in them as though behind the glass of a smiling mirror. If this incarnation of ourself in the person who seems to differ most from us is what does most to modify the appearance of the person to whom we have just been introduced, the form of that person still remains quite vague; and we are free to ask ourself whether she will turn out to be a god, a table or a basin. But, as nimble as the wax-modellers who will fashion a bust before our eyes in five minutes, the few words which the stranger is now going to say to us will substantiate her form, will give her something positive and final that will exclude all the hypotheses by which, a moment ago, our desire, our imagination were being tempted. Doubtless, even before her coming to this party, Albertine had ceased to be to me simply that sole phantom worthy to haunt our life which is what remains of a passing stranger, of whom we know nothing and have caught but the barest glimpse. Her relation to Mme. Bontemps had already restricted the scope of those marvellous hypotheses, by stopping one of the channels along which they might have spread. As I drew closer to the girl, and began to know her better, my knowledge of her underwent a process of subtraction, all the factors of imagination and desire giving place to a notion which was worth infinitely less, a notion to which, it must be admitted, there was added presently what was more or less the equivalent, in the domain of real life, of what joint stock companies give one, after paying interest on one’s capital, and call a bonus. Her name, her family connexions had been the original limit set to my suppositions. Her friendly greeting while, standing close beside her, I saw once again the tiny mole on her cheek, below her eye, marked another stage; last of all, I was surprised to hear her use the adverb ‘perfectly’ (in place of ‘quite’) of two people whom she mentioned, saying of one: “She is perfectly mad, but very nice for all that,” and of the other, “He is a perfectly common man, a perfect bore.” However little to be commended this use of ‘perfectly’ may be, it indicates a degree of civilisation and culture which I could never have imagined as having been attained by the bacchante with the bicycle, the frenzied muse of the golf-course. Nor did it mean that after this first transformation Albertine was not to change again for me, many times. The good and bad qualities which a person presents to us, exposed to view on the surface of his or her face, rearrange themselves in a totally different order if we approach them from another angle — just as, in a town, buildings that appear strung irregularly along a single line, from another aspect retire into a graduated distance, and their relative heights are altered. To begin with, Albertine now struck me as not implacable so much as almost frightened; she seemed to me rather respectably than ill bred, judging by the description, ‘bad style,’ ‘a comic manner’ which she applied to each in turn of the girls of whom I spoke to her; finally, she presented as a target for my line of sight a temple that was distinctly flushed and hardly attractive to the eye, and no longer the curious gaze which I had always connected with her until then. But this was merely a second impression and there were doubtless others through which I was successively to pass. Thus it can be only after one has recognised, not without having had to feel one’s way, the optical illusions of one’s first impression that one can arrive at an exact knowledge of another person, supposing such knowledge to be ever possible. But it is not; for while our original impression of him undergoes correction, the person himself, not being an inanimate object, changes in himself, we think that we have caught him, he moves, and, when we imagine that at last we are seeing him clearly, it is only the old impressions which we had already formed of him that we have succeeded in making clearer, when they no longer represent him

   And yet, whatever the inevitable disappointments that it must bring in its train, this movement towards what we have only half seen, what we have been free to dwell upon and imagine at our leisure, this movement is the only one that is wholesome for the senses, that whets the appetite. How dreary a monotony must pervade those people’s lives who, from indolence or timidity, drive in their carriages straight to the doors of friends whom they have got to know without having first dreamed of knowing them, without ever daring, on the way, to stop and examine what arouses their desire

   I returned home, my mind full of the party, the coffee éclair which I had finished eating before I let Elstir take me up to Albertine, the rose which I had given the old gentleman, all the details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances of the occasion, which compose in a special and quite fortuitous order the picture that we retain of a first meeting. But this picture, I had the impression that I was seeing it from a fresh point of view, a long way remote from myself, realising that it had not existed only for me, when some months later, to my great surprise, on my speaking to Albertine on the day on which I had first met her, she reminded me of the éclair, the flower that I had given away, all those things which I had supposed to have been — I will not say of importance only to myself but — perceived only by myself, and which I now found thus transcribed, in a version the existence of which I had never suspected, in the mind of Albertine. On this first day itself, when, on my return to the hotel, I was able to visualise the memory which I had brought away with me, I realised the consummate adroitness with which the sleight of hand had been performed, and how I had talked for a moment or two with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without actually embodying anything of that other person whom I had for so long been following as she paced beside the sea, had been effectively substituted for her. I might, for that matter, have guessed as much in advance, since the girl of the beach was a fabrication invented by myself. In spite of which, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified her with this other girl, I felt myself in honour bound to fulfil to the real the promises of love made to the imagined Albertine. We betroth ourselves by proxy, and think ourselves obliged, in the sequel, to marry the person who has intervened. Moreover, if there had disappeared, provisionally at any rate, from my life, an anguish that found adequate consolation in the memory of polite manners, of that expression ‘perfectly common’ and of the glowing temple, that memory awakened in me desire of another kind which, for all that it was placid and not at all painful, resembling rather brotherly love, might in the long run become fully as dangerous by making me feel at every moment a compelling need to kiss this new person, whose charming ways, shyness, unlooked-for accessibility, arrested the futile process of my imagination but gave birth to a sentimental gratitude. And then, since memory begins at once to record photographs independent of one another, eliminates every link, any kind of sequence from between the scenes portrayed in the collection which it exposes to our view, the most recent does not necessarily destroy or cancel those that came before. Confronted with the commonplace though appealing Albertine to whom I had spoken that afternoon, I still saw the other, mysterious Albertine outlined against the sea. These were now memories, that is to say pictures neither of which now seemed to me any more true than the other. But, to make an end of this first afternoon of my introduction to Albertine, when trying to recapture that little mole on her cheek, just under the eye, I remembered that, looking from Elstir’s window, when Albertine had gone by, I had seen the mole on her chin. In fact, whenever I saw her I noticed that she had a mole, but my inaccurate memory made it wander about the face of Albertine, fixing it now in one place, now in another

   Whatever my disappointment in finding in Mlle. Simonet a girl so little different from those that I knew already, just as my rude awakening when I saw Balbec Church did not prevent me from wishing still to go to Quimperlé, Pont-Aven and Venice, I comforted myself with the thought that through Albertine at any rate, even if she herself was not all that I had hoped, I might make the acquaintance of her comrades of the little band

   I thought at first that I should fail. As she was to be staying (and I too) for a long time still at Balbec, I had decided that the best thing was not to make my efforts to meet her too apparent, but to wait for an accidental encounter. But should this occur every day, even, it was greatly to be feared that she would confine herself to acknowledging my bow from a distance, and such meetings, repeated day after day throughout the whole season, would benefit me not at all

   Shortly after this, one morning when it had been raining and was almost cold, I was accosted on the ‘front’ by a girl wearing a close-fitting toque and carrying a muff, so different from the girl whom I had met at Elstir’s party that to recognise in her the same person seemed an operation beyond the power of the human mind; mine was, nevertheless, successful in performing it, but after a momentary surprise which did not, I think, escape Albertine’s notice. On the other hand, when I instinctively recalled the good breeding which had so impressed me before, she filled me with a converse astonishment by her rude tone and manners typical of the ‘little band.’ Apart from these, her temple had ceased to be the optical centre, on which the eye might comfortably rest, of her face, either because I was now on her other side, or because her toque hid it, or else possibly because its inflammation was not a constant thing. “What weather!” she began. “Really the perpetual summer of Balbec is all stuff and nonsense. You don’t go in for anything special here, do you? We don’t ever see you playing golf, or dancing at the Casino. You don’t ride, either. You must be bored stiff. You don’t find it too deadly, staying about on the beach all day? I see, you just bask in the sun like a lizard; you enjoy that. You must have plenty of time on your hands. I can see you’re not like me; I simply adore all sports. You weren’t at the Sogne races! We went in the ‘tram,’ and I can quite believe you don’t see the fun of going in an old ‘tin-pot’ like that. It took us two whole hours! I could have gone there and back three times on my bike.” I, who had been lost in admiration of Saint-Loup when he, in the most natural manner in the world, called the little local train the ‘crawler,’ because of the ceaseless windings of its line, was positively alarmed by the glibness with which Albertine spoke of the ‘tram,’ and called it a ‘tin-pot.’ I could feel her mastery of a form of speech in which I was afraid of her detecting and scorning my inferiority. And yet the full wealth of the synonyms that the little band possessed to denote this railway had not yet been revealed to me. In speaking, Albertine kept her head motionless, her nostrils closed, allowing only the corners of her lips to move. The result of this was a drawling, nasal sound, into the composition of which there entered perhaps a provincial descent, a juvenile affectation of British phlegm, the teaching of a foreign governess and a congestive hypertrophy of the mucus of the nose. This enunciation which, as it happened, soon disappeared when she knew people better, giving place to a natural girlish tone, might have been thought unpleasant. But it was peculiar to herself, and delighted me. Whenever I had gone for several days without seeing her, I would refresh my spirit by repeating to myself: “We don’t ever see you playing golf,” with the nasal intonation in which she had uttered the words, point blank, without moving a muscle of her face. And I thought then that there could be no one in the world so desirable

   We formed that morning one of those couples who dotted the ‘front’ here and there with their conjunction, their stopping together for time enough just to exchange a few words before breaking apart, each to resume separately his or her divergent stroll. I seized the opportunity, while she stood still, to look again and discover once and for all where exactly the little mole was placed. Then, just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my recollection allowed to wander from the andante to the finale, until the day when, having the score in my hands, I was able to find it, and to fix it in my memory in its proper place, in the scherzo, so this mole, which I had visualised now on her cheek, now on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just below her nose. In the same way, too, do we come with amazement upon lines that we know by heart in a poem in which we never dreamed that they were to be found

   At that moment, as if in order that against the sea there might multiply in freedom, in the variety of its forms, all the rich decorative whole which was the lovely unfolding of the train of maidens, at once golden and rosy, baked by sun and wind, Albertine’s friends, with their shapely limbs, their supple figures, but so different one from another, came into sight in a cluster that expanded as it approached, advancing towards us, but keeping closer to the sea, along a parallel line. I asked Albertine’s permission to walk for a little way with her. Unfortunately, all she did was to wave her hand to them in greeting. “But your friends will be disappointed if you don’t go with them,” I hinted, hoping that we might all walk together. A young man with regular features, carrying a bag of golf-clubs, sauntered up to us. It was the baccarat-player, whose fast ways so enraged the chief magistrate’s wife. In a frigid, impassive tone, which he evidently regarded as an indication of the highest refinement, he bade Albertine good day. “Been playing golf, Octave?” she asked. “How did the game go? Were you in form?” “Oh, it’s too sickening; I can’t play for nuts,” he replied. “Was Andrée playing?” “Yes, she went round in seventy-seven.” “Why, that’s a record!” “I went round in eighty-two yesterday.” He was the son of an immensely rich manufacturer who was to take an important part in the organisation of the coming World’s Fair. I was struck by the extreme degree to which, in this young man and in the other by no means numerous male friends of the band of girls, the knowledge of everything that pertained to clothes and how to wear them, cigars, English drinks, horses, a knowledge which he possessed in its minutest details with a haughty infallibility that approached the reticent modesty of the true expert, had been developed in complete isolation, unaccompanied by the least trace of any intellectual culture. He had no hesitation as to the right time and place for dinner-jacket or pyjamas, but neither had he any suspicion of the circumstances in which one might or might not employ this or that word, or even of the simplest rules of grammar. This disparity between the two forms of culture must have existed also in his father, the President of the Syndicate that ‘ran’ Balbec, for, in an open letter to the electors which he had recently had posted on all the walls, he announced: “I desired to see the Mayor, to speak to him of the matter; he would not listen to my righteous plaint.” Octave, at the Casino, took prizes in all the dancing competitions, for bostons, tangos and what-not, an accomplishment that would entitle him, if he chose, to make a fine marriage in that seaside society where it is not figuratively but in sober earnest that the young women ‘marry their dancing-partners.’ He lighted a cigar with a “D’you mind?” to Albertine, as one who asks permission to finish, while going on talking, an urgent piece of work. For he was one of those people who can never be ‘doing nothing,’ although there was nothing, for that matter, that he could ever be said to do. And as complete inactivity has the same effect on us, in the end, as prolonged overwork, and on the character as much as on the life of body and muscles, the unimpaired nullity of intellect that was enshrined behind Octave’s meditative brow had ended by giving him, despite his air of unruffled calm, ineffectual longings to think which kept him awake at night, for all the world like an overwrought philosopher

   Supposing that if I knew their male friends I should have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been on the point of asking for an introduction to Octave. I told Albertine this, as soon as he had left us, still muttering, “I couldn’t play for nuts!” I thought I would thus put into her head the idea of doing it next time. “But I can’t,” she cried, “introduce you to a tame cat like that. This place simply swarms with them. But what on earth would they have to say to you? That one plays golf quite well, and that’s all there is to it. I know what I’m talking about; you’d find he wasn’t at all your sort.” “Your friends will be cross with you if you desert them like this,” I repeated, hoping that she would then suggest my joining the party. “Oh, no, they don’t want me.” We ran into Bloch, who directed at me a subtle, insinuating smile, and, embarrassed by the presence of Albertine, whom he did not know, or, rather, knew ‘without knowing’ her, bent his head with a stiff, almost irritated jerk. “What’s he called, that Ostrogoth?” Albertine asked. “I can’t think why he should bow to me; he doesn’t know me. And I didn’t bow to him, either.” I had no time to explain to her, for, bearing straight down upon us, “Excuse me,” he began, “for interrupting you, but I must tell you that I am going to Don-cières to-morrow. I cannot put it off any longer without discourtesy; indeed, I ask myself, what must de Saint-Loup-en-Bray think of me. I just came to let you know that I shall take the two o’clock train. At your service.” But I thought now only of seeing Albertine again, and of trying to get to know her friends, and Doncières, since they were not going there, and my going would bring me back too late to see them still on the beach, seemed to me to be situated at the other end of the world. I told Bloch that it was impossible. “Oh, very well, I shall go alone. In the fatuous words of Master Arouet, I shall say to Saint-Loup, to beguile his clericalism:

            ‘My duty stands alone, by his in no way bound;
               Though he should choose to fail, yet faithful I’ll be found.’”

    “I admit he’s not a bad looking boy,” was Albertine’s comment, “but he makes me feel quite sick.” I had never thought that Bloch might be ‘not a bad looking boy’; and yet, when one came to think of it, so he was. With his rather prominent brow, very aquiline nose, and his air of extreme cleverness and of being convinced of his cleverness, he had a pleasing face. But he could not succeed in pleasing Albertine. This was perhaps due, to some extent, to her own disadvantages, the harshness, the want of feeling of the little band, its rudeness towards everything that was not itself. And later on, when I introduced them, Albertine’s antipathy for him grew no less. Bloch belonged to a section of society in which, between the free and easy customs of the ‘smart set’ and the regard for good manners which a man is supposed to shew who ‘does not soil his hands,’ a sort of special compromise has been reached which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a peculiarly unpleasant form of worldliness. When he was introduced to anyone he would bow with a sceptical smile, and at the same time with an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it was to a man, would say: “Pleased to meet you, sir,” in a voice which ridiculed the words that it was uttering, though with a consciousness of belonging to some one who was no fool. Having sacrificed this first moment to a custom which he at once followed and derided (just as on the first of January he would greet you with a ‘Many happy!’) he would adopt an air of infinite cunning, and would ‘proffer subtle words’ which were often true enough but ‘got on’ Albertine’s nerves. When I told her on this first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: “I would have betted anything he was a Jew-boy. Trust them to put their foot in it!” Moreover, Bloch was destined to give Albertine other grounds for annoyance later on. Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way. He would find some precious qualification for every statement, and would sweep from particular to general. It vexed Albertine, who was never too well pleased at other people’s shewing an interest in what she was doing, that when she had sprained her ankle and was keeping quiet, Bloch said of her: “She is outstretched on her chair, but in her ubiquity has not ceased to frequent simultaneously vague golf-courses and dubious tennis-courts.” He was simply being ‘literary,’ of course, but this, in view of the difficulties which Albertine felt that it might create for her with friends whose invitations she had declined on the plea that she was unable to move, was quite enough to disgust her with the face, the sound of the voice, of the young man who could say such things about her. We parted, Albertine and I, after promising to take a walk together later. I had talked to her without being any more conscious of where my words were falling, of what became of them, than if I were dropping pebbles into a bottomless pit. That our words are, as a general rule, filled, by the person to whom we address them, with a meaning which that person derives from her own substance, a meaning widely different from that which we had put into the same words when we uttered them, is a fact which the daily round of life is perpetually demonstrating. But if we find ourselves as well in the company of a person whose education (as Albertine’s was to me) is inconceivable, her tastes, her reading, her principles unknown, we cannot tell whether our words have aroused in her anything that resembles their meaning, any more than in an animal, although there are things that even an animal may be made to understand. So that to attempt any closer friendship with Albertine seemed to me like placing myself in contact with the unknown, if not the impossible, an occupation as arduous as breaking a horse, as reposeful as keeping bees or growing roses

    I had thought, a few hours before, that Albertine would acknowledge my bow but would not speak to me. We had now parted, after planning to make some excursion soon together. I vowed that when I next met Albertine I would treat her with greater boldness, and I had sketched out in advance a draft of all that I would say to her, and even (being now quite convinced that she was not strait-laced) of all the favours that I would demand of her. But the mind is subject to external influences, as plants are, and cells and chemical elements, and the medium in which its immersion alters it is a change of circumstances, or new surroundings. Grown different by the mere fact of her presence, when I found myself once again in Albertine’s company, what I said to her was not at all what I had meant to say. Remembering her flushed temple, I asked myself whether she might not appreciate more keenly a polite attention which she knew to be disinterested. Besides, I was embarrassed by certain things in her look, in her smile. They might equally well signify a laxity of morals and the rather silly merriment of a girl who though full of spirits was at heart thoroughly respectable. A single expression, on a face as in speech, is susceptible of divers interpretations, and I stood hesitating like a schoolboy faced by the difficulties of a piece of Greek prose

    On this occasion we met almost immediately the tall one, Andrée, the one who had jumped over the old banker, and Albertine was obliged to introduce me. Her friend had a pair of eyes of extraordinary brightness, like, in a dark house, a glimpse through an open door of a room into which the sun is shining with a greenish reflexion from the glittering sea

    A party of five were passing, men whom I had come to know very well by sight during my stay at Balbec. I had often wondered who they could be. “They’re nothing very wonderful,” said Albertine with a sneering laugh. “The little old one with dyed hair and yellow gloves has a fine touch; he knows how to draw all right, he’s the Balbec dentist; he’s a good sort. The fat one is the Mayor, not the tiny little fat one, you must have seen him before, he’s the dancing master; he’s rather a beast, you know; he can’t stand us, because we make such a row at the Casino; we smash his chairs, and want to have the carpet up when we dance; that’s why he never gives us prizes, though we’re the only girls there who can dance a bit. The dentist is a dear, I would have said how d’ye do to him, just to make the dancing master swear, but I couldn’t because they’ve got M. de Sainte-Croix with them; he’s on the General Council; he comes of a very good family, but he’s joined the Republicans, to make more money. No nice people ever speak to him now. He knows my uncle, because they’re both in the Government, but the rest of my family always cut him. The thin one in the waterproof is the bandmaster. You know him, of course. You don’t? Oh, he plays divinely. You haven’t been to Cavalleria Rusticana? I thought it too lovely! He’s giving a concert this evening, but we can’t go because it’s to be in the town hall. In the Casino it wouldn’t matter, but in the town hall, where they’ve taken down the crucifix. Andrée’s mother would have a fit if we went there. You’re going to say that my aunt’s husband is in the Government. But what difference does that make? My aunt is my aunt. That’s not why I’m fond of her. The only thing she has ever wanted has been to get rid of me. No, the person who has really been a mother to me, and all the more credit to her because she’s no relation at all, is a friend of mine whom I love just as much as if she was my mother. I will let you see her ‘photo.’” We were joined for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat plunger, Octave. I thought that I had discovered a bond between us, for I learned in the course of conversation that he was some sort of relative, and even more a friend of the Verdurins. But he spoke contemptuously of the famous Wednesdays, adding that M. Verdurin had never even heard of a dinner-jacket, which made it a horrid bore when one ran into him in a music-hall, where one would very much rather not be greeted with “Well, you young rascal,” by an old fellow in a frock coat and black tie, for all the world like a village lawyer. Octave left us, and soon it was Andrée’s turn, when we came to her villa, into which she vanished without having uttered a single word to me during the whole of our walk. I regretted her departure, all the more in that, while I was complaining to Albertine how chilling her friend had been with me, and was comparing in my mind this difficulty which Albertine seemed to find in making me know her friends with the hostility that Elstir, when he might have granted my desire, seemed to have encountered on that first afternoon, two girls came by to whom I lifted my hat, the young Ambresacs, whom Albertine greeted also

    I felt that, in Albertine’s eyes, my position would be improved by this meeting. They were the daughters of a kinswoman of Mme. de Ville-parisis, who was also a friend of Mme. de Luxembourg. M. and Mme. d’Ambresac, who had a small villa at Balbec and were immensely rich, led the simplest of lives there, and always went about dressed he in an unvarying frock coat, she in a dark gown. Both of them used to make sweeping bows to my grandmother, which never led to anything further. The daughters, who were very pretty, were dressed more fashionably, but in a fashion suited rather to Paris than to the seaside. With their long skirts and large hats, they had the look of belonging to a different race from Albertine. She, I discovered, knew all about them

    “Oh, so you know the little d’Ambresacs, do you? Dear me, you have some swagger friends. After all, they’re very simple souls,” she went on as though this might account for it. “They’re very nice, but so well brought up that they aren’t allowed near the Casino, for fear of us — we’ve such a bad tone. They attract you, do they? Well, it all depends on what you like. They’re just little white rabbits, really. There may be something in that, of course. If little white rabbits are what appeals to you, they may supply a long-felt want. It seems, there must be some attraction, because one of them has got engaged already to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. Which is a cruel blow to the younger one, who is madly in love with that young man. I’m sure, the way they speak to you with their lips shut is quite enough for me. And then they dress in the most absurd way. Fancy going to play golf in silk frocks! At their age, they dress more showily than grown-up women who really know about clothes. Look at Mme. Elstir; there’s a well dressed woman if you like.” I answered that she had struck me as being dressed with the utmost simplicity. Albertine laughed. “She does put on the simplest things, I admit, but she dresses wonderfully, and to get what you call simplicity costs her a fortune.” Mme. Elstir’s gowns passed unnoticed by any one who had not a sober and unerring taste in matters of attire. This was lacking in me. Elstir possessed it in a supreme degree, or so Albertine told me. I had not suspected this, nor that the beautiful but quite simple objects which littered his studio were treasures long desired by him which he had followed from sale room to sale room, knowing all their history, until he had made enough money to be able to acquire them. But as to this Albertine, being as ignorant as myself, could not enlighten me. Whereas when it came to clothes, prompted by a coquettish instinct, and perhaps by the regretful longing of a penniless girl who is able to appreciate with greater disinterestedness, more delicacy of feeling, in other, richer people the things that she will never be able to afford for herself, she expressed herself admirably on the refinement of Elstir’s taste, so hard to satisfy that all women appeared to him badly dressed, while, attaching infinite importance to right proportions and shades of colour, he would order to be made for his wife, at fabulous prices, the sunshades, hats and cloaks which he had learned from Albertine to regard as charming, and which a person wanting in taste would no more have noticed than myself. Apart from this, Albertine, who had done a little painting, though without, she confessed, having any ‘gift’ for it, felt a boundless admiration for Elstir, and, thanks to his precept and example, shewed a judgment of pictures which was in marked contrast to her enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. The truth was, though as yet it was hardly apparent, that she was highly intelligent, and that in the things that she said the stupidity was not her own but that of her environment and age. Elstir’s had been a good but only a partial influence. All the branches of her intelligence had not reached the same stage of development. The taste for pictures had almost caught up the taste for clothes and all forms of smartness, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which was still a long way behind

    Albertine might know all about the Ambresacs; but as he who can achieve great things is not necessarily capable of small, I did not find her, after I had bowed to those young ladies, any better disposed to make me known to her friends. “It’s too good of you to attach any importance to them. You shouldn’t take any notice of them; they don’t count. What on earth can a lot of kids like them mean to a man like you? Now Andrée, I must say, is remarkably clever. She is a good girl, that, though she is perfectly fantastic at times, but the others are really dreadfully stupid.” When I had left Albertine, I felt suddenly a keen regret that Saint-Loup should have concealed his engagement from me and that he should be doing anything so improper as to choose a wife before breaking with his mistress. And then, shortly afterwards, I met Andrée, and as she went on talking to me for some time I seized the opportunity to tell her that I would very much like to see her again next day, but she replied that this was impossible, because her mother was not at all well, and she would have to stay beside her. The next day but one, when I was at Elstir’s, he told me how greatly Andrée had been attracted by me; on my protesting: “But it was I who was attracted by her from the start; I asked her to meet me again yesterday, but she could not.” “Yes, I know; she told me all about that,” was his reply, “she was very sorry, but she had promised to go to a picnic, somewhere miles from here. They were to drive over in a break, and it was too late for her to get out of it.” Albeit this falsehood (Andrée knowing me so slightly) was of no real importance, I ought not to have continued to seek the company of a person who was capable of uttering it. For what people have once done they will do again indefinitely, and if you go every year to see a friend who, the first time, was not able to meet you at the appointed place, or was in bed with a chill, you will find him in bed with another chill which he has just caught, you will miss him again at another meeting-place at which he has failed to appear, for a single and unalterable reason in place of which he supposes himself to have various reasons, drawn from the circumstances. One morning, not long after An-dree’s telling me that she would be obliged to stay beside her mother, I was taking a short stroll with Albertine, whom I had found on the beach tossing up and catching again on a cord an oddly shaped implement which gave her a look of Giotto’s ‘Idolatry’; it was called, for that matter, ‘Diabolo,’ and is so fallen into disuse now that, when they come upon the picture of a girl playing with one, the critics of future generations will solemnly discuss, as it might be over one of the allegorical figures in the Arena, what it is that she is holding. A moment later their friend with the penurious and harsh appearance, the same one who on that first day had sneered so malevolently: “I do feel sorry for him, poor old man,” when, she saw the old gentleman’s head brushed by the flying feet of Andrée, came up to Albertine with “Good morning,‘m I disturbing you?” She had taken off her hat, for comfort, and her hair, like a strange and fascinating-plant, lay over her brow, displaying all the delicate tracery of its foliation^ Albertine, perhaps because she resented seeing the other bare-headed, made-no reply, preserved a frigid silence in spite of which the girl stayed with us, kept apart from myself by Albertine, who arranged at one moment to be-alone with her, at another to walk with me leaving her to follow. I was obliged, to secure an introduction, to ask for it in the girl’s hearing. Then, as Albertine was uttering my name, on the face and in the blue eyes of this girl, whose expression I had thought so cruel when I heard her say: “Poor old man, I do feel so sorry for him,” I saw gather and gleam a cordial, friendly smile, and she held out her hand. Her hair was golden, and not her hair only; for if her cheeks were pink and her eyes blue it was like the still roseate morning sky which sparkles everywhere with dazzling points of gold

    At once kindled by her flame, I said to myself that this was a child who when in love grew shy, that it was for my sake, from love for me that she had remained with us, despite Albertine’s rebuffs, and that she must have rejoiced in the opportunity to confess to me at last, by that smiling, friendly gaze, that she would be as kind to me as she was terrible to other people. Doubtless she had noticed me on the beach, when I still knew nothing of her, and had been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it had been to win my admiration that she mocked at the old gentleman, and because she had not succeeded in getting to know me that on the following days she appeared so morose. From the hotel I had often seen her, in the evenings, walking by herself on the beach. Probably in the hope of meeting me. And now, hindered as much by Albertine’s presence as she would have been by that of the whole band, she had evidently attached herself to us, braving the increasing coldness of her friend’s attitude, only in the hope of outstaying her, of being left alone with me, when she might make an appointment with me for some time when she would find an excuse to slip away without either her family’s or her friends’ knowing that she had gone, and would meet me in some safe place before church or after golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andrée had quarrelled with her and now detested her. “I have put up far too long with her terrible dishonesty,” she explained to me, “her baseness; I can’t tell you all the vile insults she has heaped on me. I have stood it all because of the others. But her latest effort was really too much!” And she told me of some foolish thing that this girl had done, which might indeed have injurious consequences to Andrée herself

    But those private words promised me by Gisèle’s confiding eyes for the moment when Albertine should have left us by ourselves, were destined never to be spoken, because after Albertine, stubbornly planted between us, had answered with increasing curtness, and finally had ceased to respond at all to her friend’s remarks, Gisèle at length abandoned the attempt and turned back. I found fault with Albertine for having been so disagreeable. “It will teach her to be more careful how she behaves. She’s not a bad kid, but she’d talk the head off a donkey. She’s no business, either, to go poking her nose into everything. Why should she fasten herself on to us without being asked? In another minute, I’d have told her to go to blazes. Besides I can’t stand her going about with her hair like that; it’s such bad form.” I gazed at Albertine’s cheeks as she spoke, and asked myself what might be the perfume, the taste of them: this time they were not cool, but glowed with a uniform pink, violet-tinted, creamy, like certain roses whose petals have a waxy gloss. I felt a passionate longing for them such as one feels sometimes for a particular flower. “I hadn’t noticed it,” was all that I said. “You stared at her hard enough; anyone would have said you wanted to paint her portrait,” she scolded, not at all softened by the fact that it was at herself that I was now staring so fixedly. “I don’t believe you would care for her, all the same. She’s not in the least a flirt. You like little girls who flirt with you, I know. Anyhow, she won’t have another chance of fastening on to us and being sent about her business; she’s going off to-day to Paris.” “Are the rest of your friends going too?” “No; only she and ‘Miss,’ because she’s got an exam, coming; she’s got to stay at home and swot for it, poor kid. It’s not much fun for her, I don’t mind telling you. Of course, you may be set a good subject, you never know. But it’s a tremendous risk. One girl I know was asked: Describe an accident that you have witnessed. That was a piece of luck. But I know another girl who got: State which you would rather have as a friend, Alceste or Philinte. I’m sure I should have dried up altogether! Apart from everything else, it’s not a question to set to girls. Girls go about with other girls; they’re not supposed to have gentlemen friends.” (This announcement, which shewed that I had but little chance of being admitted to the companionship of the band, froze my blood.) “But in any case, supposing it was set to boys, what on earth would you expect them to say to a question like that? Several parents wrote to the Gaulois, to complain of the difficult questions that were being set. The joke of it is that in a collection of prize-winning essays they gave two which treated the question in absolutely opposite ways. You see, it all depends on which examiner you get. One would like you to say that Philinte was a flatterer and a scoundrel, the other that you couldn’t help admiring Alceste, but that he was too cantankerous, and that as a friend you ought to choose Philinte. How can you expect a lot of unfortunate candidates to know what to say when the professors themselves can’t make up their minds. But that’s nothing. They get more difficult every year. Gisèle will want all her wits about her if she’s to get through.” I returned to the hotel. My grandmother was not there. I waited for her for some time; when at last she appeared, I begged her to allow me, in quite unexpected circumstances, to make an expedition which might keep me away for a couple of days. I had luncheon with her, ordered a carriage and drove to the station. Gisèle would shew no surprise at seeing me there. After we had changed at Doncières, in the. Paris train, there would be a carriage with a corridor, along which, while the governess dozed, I should be able to lead Gisèle into dark corners, and make an appointment to meet her on my return to Paris, which I would then try to put forward to the earliest possible date. I would travel with her as far as Caen or Evreux, whichever she preferred, and would take the next train back to Balbec. And yet, what would she have thought of me had she known that I had hesitated for a long time between her and her friends, that quite as much as with her I had contemplated falling in love with Albertine, with the bright-eyed girl, with Rosemonde. I felt a pang of remorse now that a bond of mutual affection was going to unite me with Gisèle. I could, moreover, truthfully have assured her that Albertine no longer interested me. I had seen her that morning as she swerved aside, almost turning her back on me, to speak to Gisèle. On her head, which was bent sullenly over her bosom, the hair that grew at the back, different from and darker even than the rest, shone as though she had just been bathing. “Like a dying duck in a thunderstorm!” I thought to myself, this view of her hair having let into Albertine’s body a soul entirely different from that implied hitherto by her glowing complexion and mysterious gaze. That shining cataract of hair at the back of her head had been for a moment or two all that I was able to see of her, and continued to be all that I saw in retrospect. Our memory is like a shop in the window of which is exposed now one, now another photograph of the same person. And as a rule the most recent exhibit remains for some time the only one to be seen. While the coachman whipped on his horse I sat there listening to the words of gratitude and affection which Gisèle was murmuring in my ear, born, all of them, of her friendly smile and outstretched hand, the fact being that in those periods of my life in which I was not actually, but desired to be in love, I carried in my mind not only an ideal form of beauty once seen, which I recognised at a glance in every passing stranger who kept far enough from me for her confused features to resist any attempt at identification, but also the moral phantom — ever ready to be incarnate — of the woman who was ‘going to fall in love with me, to take up her cues in the amorous comedy which I had had written out in my mind from my earliest boyhood, and in which every nice girl seemed to me to be equally desirous of playing, provided that she had also some of the physical qualifications required. In this play, whoever the new star might be whom I invited to create or to revive the leading part, the plot, the incidents, the lines themselves preserved an unalterable form

    Within the next few days, in spite of the reluctance that Albertine had shewn from introducing me to them, I knew all the little band of that first afternoon (except Gisèle, whom, owing to a prolonged delay at the level crossing by the station and a change in the time-table, I had not succeeded in meeting on the train, which had been gone some minutes before I arrived, and to whom as it happened I never gave another thought), and two or three other girls as well to whom at my request they introduced me. And thus, my expectation of the pleasure which I should find in a new girl springing from another girl through whom I had come to know her, the latest was like one of those new varieties of rose which gardeners get by using first a rose of another kind. And as I passed from blossom to blossom along this flowery chain, the pleasure of knowing one that was different would send me back to her to whom I was indebted for it, with a gratitude in which desire was mingled fully as much as in my new expectation. Presently I was spending all my time among these girls

    Alas! in the freshest flower it is possible to discern those just perceptible signs which to the instructed mind indicate already what will be, by the desiccation or fructification of the flesh that is to-day in bloom, the ultimate form, immutable and already predestinate, of the autumnal seed. The eye rapturously follows a nose like a wavelet that deliriously curls the water’s face at daybreak and seems not to move, to be capturable by the pencil, because the sea is so calm then that one does not notice its tidal flow. Human faces seem not to change while we are looking at them, because the revolution which they perform is too slow for us to perceive it. But we have only to see, by the side of any of those girls, her mother or her aunt, to realise the distance over which, obeying the gravitation of a type that is, generally speaking, deplorable, her features will have travelled in less than thirty years, and must continue to travel until the sunset hour, until her face, having vanished altogether below the horizon, catches the light no more. I knew that, as deep, as ineluctable as is their Jewish patriotism or Christian atavism in those who imagine themselves to be the most emancipated of their race, there dwelt beneath the rosy inflorescence of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée, unknown to themselves, held in reserve until the circumstances should arise, a coarse nose, a protruding jaw, a bust that would create a sensation when it appeared, but was actually in the wings, ready to “come on,” just as it might be a burst of Dreyfusism, or clericalism, sudden, unforeseen, fatal, some patriotic, some feudal form of heroism emerging suddenly when the circumstances demand it from a nature anterior to that of the man himself, by means of which he thinks, lives, evolves, gains strength himself or dies, without ever being able to distinguish that nature from the successive phases which in turn he takes for it. Even mentally, we depend a great deal more than we think upon natural laws, and our mind possesses already, like some cryptogamous plant, every little peculiarity that we imagine ourselves to be selecting. For we can see only the derived ideas, without detecting the primary cause (Jewish blood, French birth or whatever it may be) that inevitably produced them, and which at a given moment we expose. And perhaps, while the former appear to us to be the result of deliberate thought, the latter that of an imprudent disregard for our own health, we take from our family, as the papilionaceae take the form of their seed, as well the ideas by which we live as the malady from which we shall die

    As on a plant whose flowers open at different seasons, I had seen, expressed in the form of old ladies, on this Balbec shore, those shrivelled seed-pods, those flabby tubers which my friends would one day be. But what matter? For the moment it was their flowering-time. And so when Mme. de Villeparisis asked me to drive with her I sought an excuse to be prevented. I never went to see Elstir unless accompanied by my new friends. I could not even spare an afternoon to go to Doncières, to pay the visit I had promised Saint-Loup. Social engagements, serious discussions, even a friendly conversation, had they usurped the place allotted to my walks with these girls, would have had the same effect on me as if, when the luncheon bell rang, I had been taken not to a table spread with food but to turn the pages of an album. The men, the youths, the women, old or mature, whose society we suppose that we shall enjoy, are borne by us only on an unsubstantial plane surface, because we are conscious of them only by visual perception restricted to its own limits; whereas it is as delegates from our other senses that our eyes dart towards young girls; the senses follow, one after another, in search of the various charms, fragrant, tactile, savoury, which they thus enjoy even without the aid of fingers and lips; and able, thanks to the art of transposition, the genius for synthesis in which desire excels, to reconstruct beneath the hue of cheeks or bosom the feel, the taste, the contact that is forbidden them, they give to these girls the same honeyed consistency as they create when they stand rifling the sweets of a rose-garden, or before a vine whose clusters their eyes alone devour

    If it rained, although the weather had no power to daunt Albertine, who was often to be seen in her waterproof spinning on her bicycle through the driving showers, we would Spend the day in the Casino, where on such days it would have seemed to me impossible not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young Ambresacs, who had never set foot in it. And I willingly joined my friends in playing tricks on the dancing master. As a rule we had to listen to admonition from the manager, or from some of his staff, usurping dictatorial powers, because my friends, even Andrée herself, whom on that account I had regarded when I first saw her as so dionysiac a creature, whereas in reality she was delicate, intellectual, and this year far from well, in spite of which her actions were controlled less by the state of her health than by the spirit of that age which overcomes every other consideration and confounds in a general gaiety the weak with the strong, could not enter the outer hall of the rooms without starting to run, jumping over all the chairs, sliding back along the floor, their balance maintained by a graceful poise of their outstretched arms, singing the while, mingling all the arts, in that first bloom of youth, in the manner of those poets of ancient days for whom the different ‘kinds’ were not yet separate, so that in an epic poem they would introduce rules of agriculture with theological doctrine

    This Andrée who had struck me when I first saw them as the coldest of them all, was infinitely more refined, more loving, more sensitive than Albertine, to whom she displayed the caressing, gentle affection of an elder sister. At the Casino she would come across the floor to sit down by me, and knew instinctively, unlike Albertine, to refuse my invitation to dance, or even, if I was tired, to give up the Casino and come to me instead at the hotel. She expressed her friendship for me, for Albertine, in terms which were evidence of the most exquisite understanding of the things of the heart, which may have been partly due to the state of her health. She had always a merry smile of excuse for the childish behaviour of Albertine, who expressed with a crude violence the irresistible temptation held out to her by the parties and picnics to which she had not the sense, like Andrée, resolutely to prefer staying and talking with me. When the time came for her to go off to a luncheon party at the golf-club, if we were all three together she would get ready to leave us, then, coming up to Andrée: “Well, Andrée, what are you waiting for now? You know we are lunching at the golf-club.” “No; I’m going to stay and talk to him,” replied Andrée, pointing to me. “But you know, Mme. Durieux invited you,” cried Albertine, as if Andree’s intention to remain with me could be explained only by ignorance on her part where else and by whom she had been bidden. “Look here, my good girl, don’t be such an idiot,” Andrée chid her. Albertine did not insist, fearing a suggestion that she too should stay with me. She tossed her head. “Just as you like,” was her answer, uttered in the tone one uses to an invalid whose self-indulgence is killing him by inches, “I must fly; I’m sure your watch is slow,” and off she went. “She is a dear girl, but quite impossible,” said Andrée, bathing her friend in a smile at once caressing and critical. If in this craze for amusement Albertine might be said to echo something of the old original Gilberte, that is because a certain similarity exists, although the type evolves, between all the women we love, a similarity that is due to the fixity of our own temperament, which it is that chooses them, eliminating all those who would not be at once our opposite and our complement, fitted that is to say to gratify our senses and to wring our heart. They are, these women, a product of our temperament, an image inversely projected, a negative of our sensibility. So that a novelist might, in relating the life of his hero, describe his successive love-affairs in almost exactly similar terms, and thereby give the impression not that he was repeating himself but that he was creating, since an artificial novelty is never so effective as a repetition that manages to suggest a fresh truth. He ought, moreover, to indicate in the character of the lover a variability which becomes apparent as the story moves into fresh regions, into different latitudes of life. And perhaps he would be stating yet another truth if while investing all the other persons of his story with distinct characters he refrained from giving any to the beloved. We understand the characters of people who do not interest us; how can we ever grasp that of a person who is an intimate part of our existence, whom after a little we no longer distinguish in any way from ourselves, whose motives provide us with an inexhaustible supply of anxious hypotheses which we perpetually reconstruct. Springing from somewhere beyond our understanding, our curiosity as to the woman whom we love overleaps the bounds of that woman’s character, which we might if we chose but probably will not choose to stop and examine. The object of our uneasy investigation is something more essential than those details of character comparable to the tiny particles of epidermis whose varied combinations form the florid originality of human flesh. Our intuitive radiography pierces them, and the images which it photographs for us, so far from being those of any single face, present rather the joyless universality of a skeleton

    Andrée, being herself extremely rich while the other was penniless and an orphan, with real generosity lavished on Albertine the full benefit of her wealth. As for her feelings towards Gisèle, they were not quite what I had been led to suppose. News soon reached us of the young student, and when Albertine handed round the letter she had received, a letter intended by Gisèle to give an account of her journey and to report her safe arrival to the little band, pleading laziness as an excuse for not having written yet to the rest, I was surprised to hear Andrée (for I imagined an irreparable breach between them) say: “I shall write to her to-morrow, because if I wait for her to write I may have to wait for years, she’s such a slacker.” And, turning to myself, she added: “You saw nothing much in her, evidently; but she’s a jolly nice girl, and besides I’m really very fond of her.” From which I concluded that Andrée’s quarrels were apt not to last very long

    Except on these rainy days, as we had always arranged to go on our bicycles along the cliffs, or on an excursion inland, an hour or so before it was time to start I would go upstairs to make myself smart and would complain if Françoise had not laid out all the things that I wanted. Now even in Paris she would proudly, angrily straighten a back which the years had begun to bend, at the first word of reproach, she so humble, she so modest and charming when her self-esteem was flattered. As this was the mainspring of her life: her satisfaction, her good humour were in direct ratio to the difficulty of the tasks imposed on her. Those which she had to perform at Balbec were so easy that she shewed almost all the time a discontent which was suddenly multiplied an hundredfold, with the addition of an ironic air of offended dignity when I complained, on my way down to join my friends, that my hat had not been brushed or my ties sorted. She who was capable of taking such endless pains, without in consequence assuming that she had done anything at all, on my simply remarking that a coat was not in its proper place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had “put it past sooner than let it go gathering the dust,” but, paying a formal tribute to her own labours, lamented that it was little enough of a holiday that she was getting at Balbec, and that we would not find another person in the whole world who would consent to put up with such treatment. “I can’t think how anyone can leave things lying about the way you do; you just try and get anyone else to find what you want in such a mix-up. The devil himself would give it up as a bad job.” Or else she would adopt a regal mien, scorching me with her fiery glance, and preserve a silence that was broken as soon as she had fastened the door behind her and was outside in the passage, which would then reverberate with utterances which I guessed to be insulting, though they remained as indistinct as those of characters in a play whose opening lines are spoken in the wings, before they appear on the stage. And even if nothing was missing and Françoise was in a good temper, still she made herself quite intolerable when I was getting ready to go out with my friends. For, drawing upon a store of stale witticisms at their expense which, in my need to be talking about the girls, I had made in her hearing, she put on an air of being about to reveal to me things of which I should have known more than she had there been any truth in her statements, which there never was, Françoise having misunderstood what she had heard. She had, like most people, her own ways; a person is never like a straight highway, but surprises us with the strange, unavoidable windings of his course through life, by which, though some people may not notice them, we find it a perpetual annoyance to be stopped and hindered. Whenever I arrived at the stage of “Where is my hat?” or uttered the name of Andrée or Albertine, I was forced by Françoise to stray into endless and absurd side-tracks which greatly delayed my progress. So too when I asked her to cut me the sandwiches of cheese or salad, or sent her out for the cakes which I was to eat while we rested on the cliffs, sharing them with the girls, and which the girls “might very well have taken turns to provide, if they had not been so close,” declared Françoise, to whose aid there came at such moments a whole heritage of atavistic peasant rapacity and coarseness, and for whom one would have said that the soul of her late enemy Eulalie had been broken into fragments and reincarnate, more attractively than it had ever been in Saint-Eloi’s, in the charming bodies of my friends of the little band. I listened to these accusations with a dull fury at finding myself brought to a standstill at one of those places beyond which the well-trodden country path that was Françoise’s character became impassable, though fortunately never for very long. Then, my hat or coat found and the sandwiches ready, I sailed out to find Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, and any others there might be, and on foot or on our bicycles we would start

    In the old days I should have preferred our excursion to be made in bad weather. For then I still looked to find in Balbec the ‘Cimmerians’ land,’ and fine days were a thing that had no right to exist there, an intrusion of the vulgar summer of seaside holiday-makers into that ancient region swathed in eternal mist. But now, everything that I had hitherto despised, shut out of my field of vision, not only effects of sunlight upon sea and shore, but even the regattas, the race-meetings, I would have sought out with ardour, for the reason for which formerly I had wanted only stormy seas, which was that these were now associated in my mind, as the others had been, with an aesthetic idea. Because I had gone several times with my new friends to visit Elstir, and, on the days when the girls were there, what he had selected to shew us were drawings of pretty women in yachting dress, or else a sketch made on a race-course near Balbec. I had at first shyly admitted to Elstir that I had not felt inclined to go to the meetings that were being held there. “You were wrong,” he told me, “it is such a pretty sight, and so well worth seeing. For one thing, that peculiar animal, the jockey, on whom so many eager eyes are fastened, who in the paddock there looks so grim, a colourless face between his brilliant jacket and cap, one body and soul with the prancing horse he rides, how interesting to analyse his professional movements, the bright splash of colour he makes, with the horse’s coat blending in it, as they stream down the course. What a transformation of every visible object in that luminous vastness of a racecourse where one is constantly surprised by fresh lights and shades which one sees only there. How charming the women can look there, too! The first day’s racing was quite delightful, and there were women there exquisitely dressed, in the misty light of a Dutch landscape, in which one could feel rising to cloud the sun itself the penetrating coldness of the water. Never have I seen women arriving in carriages, or standing with glasses to their eyes in so extraordinary a light, which was due, I suppose, to the moisture from the sea. I should simply have loved to paint it. I came home from the races quite mad, and so keen to get to work! “After which he became more enthusiastic still over the yacht-races, and I realised that regattas, social fixtures where well-dressed women might be seen bathed in the greenish light of a marine race-course, might be for a modern artist as interesting a subject as were the revels which they so loved to depict for a Veronese or Carpaccio. When I suggested this to Elstir, “Your comparison is all the more true,” he replied, “since, from the position of the city in which they painted, those revels were to a great extent aquatic. Except that the beauty of the shipping in those days lay as a rule in its solidity, in the complication of its structure. They had water-tournaments, as we have here, held generally in honour of some Embassy, such as Carpaccio shews us in his Legend of Saint Ursula. The vessels were massive, built up like architecture, and seemed almost amphibious, like lesser Venices set in the heart of the greater, when, moored to the banks by hanging stages decked with crimson satin and Persian carpets, they bore their freight of ladies in cherry-red brocade and green damask close under the balconies incrusted with many-coloured marbles from which other ladies leaned to gaze at them, in gowns with black sleeves slashed with white, stitched with pearls or bordered with lace. You cannot tell where the land ends and the water begins, what is still the palace or already the vessel, the caravel, the galeas, the Bucintoro.” Albertine had listened with the keenest interest to these details of costume, these visions of elegance that Elstir was describing to us. “Oh, I should so like to see that lace you speak of; it’s so pretty, the Venice-point,” she cried. “Besides, I should love to see Venice.” “You may, perhaps, before very long, be able,” Elstir informed her, “to gaze upon the marvellous stuffs which they used to wear. Hitherto one has seen them only in the works of the Venetian painters, or very rarely among the treasures of old churches, except now and then when a specimen has come into the sale-room. But I hear that a Venetian artist, called Fortuny, has recovered the secret of the craft, and that before many years have passed women will be able to walk abroad, and better still to sit at home in brocades as sumptuous as those that Venice adorned, for her patrician daughters, with patterns brought from the Orient. But I don’t know that I should much care for that, that it wouldn’t be too much of an anachronism for the women of to-day, even when they parade at regattas, for, to return to our modern pleasure-craft, the times have completely changed since ‘Venice, Queen of the Adriatic.’ The great charm of a yacht, of the furnishings of a yacht, of yachting dress, is their simplicity, as just things for the sea, and I do so love the sea. I must confess to you that I prefer the fashions of to-day to those of Veronese’s and even of Carpaccio’s time. What there is so attractive about our yachts — and the smaller yachts especially, I don’t like the huge ones, they’re too much like ships; yachts are like women’s hats, you must keep within certain limits — is the unbroken surface, simple, gleaming, grey, which under a cloudy, leaden sky takes on a creamy softness. The cabin in which we live ought to make us think of a little café. And women’s clothes on board a yacht are the same sort of thing; what really are charming are those light garments, uniformly white, of cloth or linen or nankeen or drill, which in the sunlight and against the blue of the sea shew up with as dazzling a whiteness as a spread sail. You very seldom see a woman, for that matter, who knows how to dress, and yet some of them are quite wonderful. At the races, Mlle. Léa had a little white hat and a little white sunshade, simply enchanting. I don’t know what I wouldn’t give for that little sunshade.” I should have liked very much to know in what respect this little sunshade differed from any other, and for other reasons, reasons of feminine vanity, Albertine was still more curious. But, just as Françoise used to explain the excellence of her soufflés by “It’s the way you do them,” so here the difference lay in the cut. “It was,” Elstir explained, “quite tiny, quite round, like a Chinese umbrella.” I mentioned the sunshades carried by various ladies, but it was not like any of them. Elstir found them all quite hideous. A man of exquisite taste, singularly hard to please, he would isolate some minute detail which was the whole difference between what was worn by three-quarters of the women he saw, and horrified him, and a thing which enchanted him by its prettiness; and — in contrast to its effect on myself, whose mind any display of luxury at once sterilised — stimulated his desire to paint “so as to make something as attractive.” “Here you see a young lady who has guessed what the hat and sunshade were like,” he said to me, pointing to Albertine whose eyes shone with envy. “How I should love to be rich, to have a yacht!” she said to the painter. “I should come to you to tell me how to run it. What lovely trips I’d take. And what fun it would be to go to Cowes for the races. And a motor-car! Tell me, do you think the ladies’ fashions for motoring pretty?” “No”; replied Elstir, “but that will come in time. You see, there are very few firms at present, one or two only, Callot — although they go in rather too freely for lace — Doucet, Cheruit, Paquin sometimes. The others are all horrible.” “Then, is there a vast difference between a Callot dress and one from any ordinary shop?” I asked Albertine. “Why, an enormous difference, my little man! I beg your pardon! Only, alas! what you get for three hundred francs in an ordinary shop will cost two thousand there. But there can be no comparison; they look the same only to people who know nothing at all about it.” “Quite so,” put in Elstir; “though I should not go so far as to say that it is as profound as the difference between a statue from Rheims Cathedral and one from Saint-Augustin. By the way, talking of cathedrals,” he went on, addressing himself exclusively to me, because what he was saying had reference to an earlier conversation in which the girls had not taken part, and which for that matter would not have interested them at all, “I spoke to you the other day of Balbec Church as a great cliff, a huge breakwater built of the stone of the country; now look at this”; he handed me a water-colour. “Look at these cliffs (it’s a sketch I did close to here, at the Creuniers); don’t these rocks remind you of a cathedral?” And indeed one would have taken them for soaring red arches. But, painted on a roasting hot day, they seemed to have crumbled into dust, made volatile by the heat which had drunk up half the sea, distilled over the whole surface of the picture almost into a gaseous state. On this day on which the sunlight had, so to speak, destroyed reality, reality concentrated itself in certain dusky and transparent creatures which, by contrast, gave a more striking, a closer impression of life: the shadows. Ravening after coolness, most of them, deserting the scorched open spaces, had fled for shelter to the foot of the rocks, out of reach of the sun; others, swimming gently upon the tide, like dolphins, kept close under the sides of the moving vessels, whose hulls they extended upon the pale surface of the water with their glossy blue forms. It was perhaps the thirst for coolness which they conveyed that did most to give me the sensation of the heat of this day and made me exclaim how much I regretted not knowing the Creuniers. Albertine and Andrée were positive that I must have been there hundreds of times. If so I had been there without knowing it, never suspecting that one day the sight of these rocks was to inspire me with such a thirst for beauty, not perhaps exactly natural beauty such as I had been seeking hitherto among the cliffs of Balbec, but rather architectural. Above all, I who, having come here to visit the kingdom of the storm, had never found, on any of my drives with Mme. de Villeparisis, when often we saw it only from afar, painted in a gap between the trees, the ocean sufficiently real, sufficiently liquid, giving a sufficient impression that it was hurling its massed forces against the shore, and would have liked to see it lie motionless only under a wintry shroud of fog, I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was nothing more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had so intensely felt the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon the painted sheet the imperceptible reflux of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and one suddenly became so enamoured, at the sight of this magic portrait, that one could think of nothing else than to range the world over, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty

    So that if before these visits to Elstir, before I had set eyes on one of his sea-pictures in which a young woman in a dress of white serge or linen, on the deck of a yacht flying the American flag, had duplicated a white linen dress and coloured flag in my imagination which at once bred in me an insatiable desire to visit the spot and see there with my own eyes white linen dresses and flags against the sea, as though no such experience had ever yet befallen me, always until then I had taken care when I stood by the sea to expel from my field of vision, as well as the bathers in the foreground, the yachts with their too dazzling sails that were like seaside costumes, everything that prevented me from persuading myself that I was contemplating the immemorial flood of ocean which had been moving with the same mysterious life before the appearance of the human race; and had grudged even the days of radiant sunshine which seemed to me to invest with the trivial aspect of the world’s universal summer this coast of fog and tempest, to mark simply an interruption, equivalent to what in music is known as a rest; now on the other hand it was the bad days that appeared to me to be some disastrous accident, a thing that could no longer find any place for itself in the world of beauty; I felt a keen desire to go out and recapture in reality what had so powerfully aroused my imagination, and I hoped that the weather would be propitious enough for me to see from the summit of the cliff the same blue shadows as were in Elstir’s picture

    Nor, as I went along, did I still make a frame about my eyes with my hands as in the days when, conceiving nature to be animated by a life anterior to the first appearance of man, and inconsistent with all those wearisome perfections of industrial achievement which had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at Universal Exhibitions or in the milliners’ windows, I endeavoured to include only that section of the sea over which there was no steamer passing, so that I might picture it to myself as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages in which it had been set apart from the land, or at least with the first dawn of life in Greece, which enabled me to repeat in their literal meaning the lines of ‘Father Leconte’ of which Bloch was so fond:

            ‘Gone are the Kings, gone are their towering prows
            Vanished upon the raging deep, alas
            The long-haired warrior heroes of Hellas.’

    I could no longer despise the milliners, now that Elstir had told me that the delicate touches by which they give a last refinement, a supreme caress to the ribbons or feathers of a hat after it is finished, would be as interesting to him to paint as the muscular action of the jockeys themselves (a statement which had delighted Albertine). But I must wait until I had returned — for milliners, to Paris — for regattas and races to Balbec, where there would be no more now until next year-. Even a yacht with women in white linen garments was not to be found

    Often we encountered Bloch’s sisters, to whom I was obliged to bow since I had dined with their father. My new friends did not know them. “I am not allowed to play with Israelites,” Albertine explained. Her way of pronouncing the word —‘Issraelites’ instead of ‘Izraelites’— would in itself have sufficed to shew, even if one had not heard the rest of the sentence, that it was no feeling of friendliness towards the chosen race that inspired these young Frenchwomen, brought up in God-fearing homes, and quite ready to believe that the Jews were in the habit of massacring Christian children. “Besides, they’re shocking bad form, your friends,” said Andrée with a smile which implied that she knew very well that they were no friends of mine. “Like everything to do with the tribe,” went on Albertine, in the sententious tone of one who spoke from personal experience. To tell the truth, Bloch’s sisters, at once overdressed and half naked, with their languishing, bold, blatant, sluttish air did not create the best impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen, scandalised the Casino by her unconcealed admiration for Mlle. Lea, whose talent as an actress M. Bloch senior rated very high, but whose tastes were understood to lead her not exactly in the direction of the gentlemen

    Some days we took our refreshment at one of the outlying farms which catered to visitors. These were the farms known as Les Ecorres, Marie-Thérèse, La Croix d’Heuland, Bagatelle, Californie and Marie-Antoinette. It was the last that had been adopted by the little band

    But at other times, instead of going to a farm, we would climb to the highest point of the cliff, and, when we had reached it and were seated on the grass, would undo our parcel of sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred the sandwiches, and were surprised to see me eat only a single chocolate cake, sugared with gothic tracery, or an apricot tart. This was because, with the sandwiches of cheese or of green-stuff, a form of food that was novel to me and knew nothing of the past, I had nothing in common. But the cakes understood, the tarts were gossips. There were in the former an insipid taste of cream, in the latter a fresh taste of fruit which knew all about Combray, and about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte of Combray but her too of Paris, at whose tea-parties I had found them again. They reminded me of those cake-plates of the Arabian Nights pattern, the subjects on which were such a distraction to my aunt Léonie when Françoise brought her up, one day, Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another day Ali-Baba, or the Sleeper Awakes, or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Bassorah with all his treasure. I should dearly have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them, and thought moreover that they were just common plates that had been bought in the village. No matter, in that grey, midland Combray scene they and their pictures were set like many-coloured jewels, as in the dark church were the windows with their shifting radiance, as in the dusk of my bedroom were the projections cast by the magic-lantern, as in the foreground of the view of the railway-station and the little local line the buttercups from the Indies and the Persian lilacs, as were my great-aunt’s shelves of old porcelain in the sombre dwelling of an elderly lady in a country town

    Stretched out on the cliff I would see before me nothing but grassy meadows and beyond them not the seven heavens of the Christian cosmogony but two stages only, one of a deeper blue, the sea, and over it another more pale. We ate our food, and if I had brought with me also some little keepsake which might appeal to one or other of my friends, joy sprang with such sudden violence into her translucent face, flushed in an instant, that her lips had not the strength to hold it in, and to allow it to escape parted in a shout of laughter. They had gathered close round me, and between their faces which were almost touching one another the air that separated them traced azure pathways such as might have been cut by a gardener wishing to clear the ground a little so as to be able himself to move freely through a thicket of roses

    When we had finished eating we would play games which until then I should have thought boring, sometimes such childish games as King of the Castle, or Who Laughs First; not for a kingdom would I have renounced them now; the rosy dawn of adolescence, with which the faces of these girls were still aglow, and from which I, young as I was, had already emerged, shed its light on everything round about them and, like the fluid painting of some of the Primitives, brought out the most insignificant details of their daily lives in relief against a golden background. Even the faces of the girls were, for the most part, clouded with this misty effulgence of a dawn from which their actual features had not yet emerged. One saw only a charming sheet of colour beneath which what in a few years’ time would be a profile was not discernible. The profile of to-day had nothing definite about it, and could be only a momentary resemblance to some deceased member of the family to whom nature had paid this commemorative courtesy. It comes so soon, the moment when there is nothing left to wait for, when the body is fixed in an immobility which holds no fresh surprise in store, when one loses all hope on seeing — as on a tree in the height of summer leaves already brown — round a face still young hair that is growing thin or turning grey; it is so short, that radiant morning time that one comes to like only the very youngest girls, those in whom the flesh, like a precious leaven, is still at work. They are no more yet than a stream of ductile matter, moulded ever afresh by the fleeting impression of the moment. You would say that each of them was in turn a little statuette of childish gaiety, of a child grown earnest, coaxing, surprised, taking its pattern from an expression frank and complete, but fugitive. This plasticity gives a wealth of variety and charm to the pretty attentions which a little girl pays to us. Of course, such attentions are indispensable in the woman also, and she whom we do not attract, or who fails to let us see that we have attracted her, tends to assume in our eyes a somewhat tedious uniformity. But even these pretty attentions, after a certain age, cease to send gentle ripples over a face which the struggle for existence has hardened, has rendered unalterably militant or ecstatic. One — owing to the prolonged strain of the obedience that subjects wife to husband — will seem not so much a woman’s face as a soldier’s; another, carved by the sacrifices which a mother has consented to make, day after day, for her children, will be the face of an apostle. A third is, after a stormy passage through the years, the face of an ancient mariner, upon a body of which its garments alone indicate the sex. Certainly the attentions that a woman pays us can still, so long as we are in love with her, scatter fresh charms over the hours that we spend in her company. But she is not then for us a series of different women. Her gaiety remains external to an unchanging face. Whereas adolescence is anterior to this complete solidification; and from this it follows that we feel, in the company of young girls, the refreshing sense that is afforded us by the spectacle of forms undergoing an incessant process of change, a play of unstable forces which makes us think of that perpetual re-creation of the primordial elements of nature which we contemplate when we stand by the sea

    It was not merely a social engagement, a drive with Mme. de Villeparisis, that I would have sacrificed to the ‘Ferret’ or ‘Guessing Games’ of my friends. More than once, Robert de Saint-Loup had sent word that, since I was not coming to see him at Doncières, he had applied for twenty-four hours’ leave, which he would spend at Balbec. Each time I wrote back that he was on no account to come, offering the excuse that I should be obliged to be away myself that very day, when I had some duty call to pay with my grandmother on family friends in the neighbourhood. No doubt I fell in his estimation when he learned from his aunt in what the ‘duty call’ consisted, and who the persons were who combined to play the part of my grandmother. And yet I had not been wrong, perhaps, after all, in sacrificing not only the vain pleasures of the world but the real pleasure of friendship to that of spending the whole day in this green garden. People who enjoy the capacity — it is true that such people are artists, and I had long been convinced that I should never be that — are also under an obligation to live for themselves. And friendship is a dispensation from this duty, an abdication of self. Even conversation, which is the mode of expression of friendship, is a superficial digression which gives us no new acquisition. We may talk for a lifetime without doing more than indefinitely repeat the vacuity of a minute, whereas the march of thought in the solitary travail of artistic creation proceeds downwards, into the depths, in the only direction that is not closed to us, along which we are free to advance — though with more effort, it is true — towards a goal of truth. And friendship is not merely devoid of virtue, like conversation, it is fatal to us as well. For the sense of boredom which it is impossible not to feel in a friend’s company (when, that is to say, we must remain exposed on the surface of our consciousness, instead of pursuing our voyage of discovery into the depths) for those of us in whom the law of development is purely internal — that first impression of boredom our friendship impels us to correct when we are alone again, to recall with emotion the words uttered by our friend, to look upon them as a valuable addition to our substance, albeit we are not like buildings to which stones can be added from without, but like trees which draw from their own sap the knot that duly appears on their trunks, the spreading roof of their foliage. I was lying to myself, I was interrupting the process of growth in that direction in which I could indeed really be enlarged and made happy, when I congratulated myself on being liked, admired, by so good, so clever, so rare a creature as Saint-Loup, when I focussed my mind, not upon my own obscure impressions which duty bade me unravel, but on the words uttered by my friend, in which, when I repeated them to myself — when I had them repeated to me by that other self who dwells in us and on to whom we are always so ready to transfer the burden of taking thought — I strove to make myself find a beauty very different from that which I used to pursue in silence when I was really alone, but one that would enhance the merit of Robert, of myself, of my life. In the life which a friend like this provided for me, I seemed to myself to be comfortably preserved from solitude, nobly desirous of sacrificing myself for him, in fact quite incapable of realising myself. Among the girls, on the other hand, if the pleasure which I enjoyed was selfish, at least it was not based on the lie which seeks to make us believe that we are not irremediably alone, and which, when we talk to another person, prevents us from admitting that it is no longer we who speak, that we are fashioning ourselves in the likeness of strangers and not of our own ego, which is quite different from them. The words that passed between the girls of the little band and myself were not of any interest; they were, moreover, but few, broken by long spells of silence on my part. All of which did not prevent me from finding, in listening to them when they spoke to me, as much pleasure as in gazing at them, in discovering in the voice of each one of them a brightly coloured picture. It was with ecstasy that I caught their pipings. Love helps us to discern things, to discriminate. Standing in a wood, the lover of birds at once distinguishes the notes of the different species, which to ordinary people sound the same. The lover of girls knows that human voices vary even more. Each one possesses more notes than the richest instrument of music. And the combinations in which the voice groups those notes are as inexhaustible as the infinite variety of personalities. When I talked with any one of my friends I was conscious that the original, the unique portrait of her individuality had been skilfully traced, tyranically imposed on my mind as much by the inflexions of her voice as by those of her face, and that these were two separate spectacles which rendered, each in its own plane, the same single reality. No doubt the lines of the voice, like those of the face, were not yet definitely fixed; the voice had still to break, as the face to change. Just as children have a gland the secretion in which enables them to digest milk, a gland which is not found in grown men and women, so there were in the twitterings of these girls notes which women’s voices no longer contain. And on this instrument with its greater compass they played with their lips, shewing all the application, the ardour of Bellini’s little angel musicians, qualities which also are an exclusive appanage of youth. Later on these girls would lose that note of enthusiastic conviction which gave a charm to their simplest utterances, whether it were Albertine who, in a tone of authority, repeated puns to which the younger ones listened with admiration, until that wild impulse to laugh caught them all with the irresistible violence of a sneeze, or Andrée who began to speak of their work in the schoolroom, work even more childish seemingly than the games they played, with a gravity essentially puerile; and their words changed in tone, like the lyrics of ancient times when poetry, still hardly differentiated from music, was declaimed upon the different notes of a scale. In spite of which, the girls’ voices already gave a quite clear indication of the attitude that each of these little people had adopted towards life, an attitude so personal that it would be speaking in far too general terms to say of one: “She treats everything as a joke,” of another: “She jumps from assertion to assertion,” of a third: “She lives in a state of expectant hesitation.” The features of our face are hardly more than gestures which force of habit has made permanent. Nature, like the destruction of Pompeii, like the metamorphosis of a nymph into a tree, has arrested us in an accustomed movement. Similarly, our intonations embody our philosophy of life, what a person says to himself about things at any given moment. No doubt these peculiarities were to be found not only in the girls. They were those of their parents. The individual is a part of something that is more generally diffused than himself. By this reckoning, our parents furnish us not only with those habitual gestures which are the outlines of our face and voice, but also with certain mannerisms in speech, certain favourite expressions, which, almost as unconscious as an intonation, almost as profound, indicate likewise a definite point of view towards life. It is quite true, since we are speaking of girls, that there are certain of these expressions which their parents do not hand on to them until they have reached a certain age, as a rule not before they are women. These are kept in reserve. Thus, for instance, if you were to speak of the pictures of one of Elstir’s friends, Andrée, whose hair was still ‘down,’ could not yet make use, personally, of the expression which her mother and elder sister employed: “It appears, the man is quite charming!” But that would come in due course, when she was allowed to go to the Palais-Royal. And already, since her first communion, Albertine had begun to say, like a friend of her aunt: “I’m sure I should find that simply terrible!” She had also had given to her, as a little present, the habit of repeating whatever you had just been saying to her, so as to appear to be interested, and to be trying to form an opinion of her own. If you said that an artist’s work was good, or his house nice, “Oh, his work is good, is it?” “Oh, his house is nice, is it?” Last of all, and even more general than the family heritage, was the rich layer imposed by the native province from which they derived their voices and of which indeed their intonations smacked. When Andrée sharply struck a solemn note she could not prevent the Perigordian string of her vocal instrument from giving back a resonant sound quite in harmony, moreover, with the Meridional purity of her features; while to the incessant pranks of Rosemonde the substance of her North-Country face and voice responded, whatever her mood at the time, in the accent of their province. Between that province and the temperament of the little girl who dictated these inflexions, I caught a charming dialogue. A dialogue, not in any sense a discord. It would not have been possible to separate the girl herself and her native place. She was herself; she was still it also. Moreover this reaction of locally procured materials on the genius who utilises them and to whose work their reaction imparts an added freshness, does not make the work any less individual, and whether it be that of an architect, a cabinet-maker or a composer, it reflects no less minutely the most subtle shades of the artist’s personality, because he has been compelled to work in the millstone of Senlis or the red sandstone of Strasbourg, has respected the knots peculiar to the ash-tree, has borne in mind, when writing his score, the resources, the limitations, the volume of sound, the possibilities of flute or alto voice

    All this I realised, and yet we talked so little. Whereas with Mme. de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup I should have displayed by my words a great deal more pleasure than I should actually have felt, for I used always to be worn out when I parted from them; when, on the other hand, I was lying on the grass among all these girls, the plenitude of what I was feeling infinitely outweighed the paucity, the infrequency of our speech, and brimmed over from my immobility and silence in floods of happiness, the waves of which rippled up to die at the feet of these young roses

    For a convalescent who rests all day long in a flower-garden or orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes grow sugary in sunshine. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and growing sunburned, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague sense of dizziness that had spread from brain to eyes

    Now and then a pretty attention from one or another of them would stir in me vibrations which dissipated for a time my desire for the rest. Thus one day Albertine had suddenly asked: “Who has a pencil?” Andrée had provided one, Rosemonde the paper; Albertine had warned them: “Now, young ladies, you are not to look at what I write.” After carefully tracing each letter, supporting the paper on her knee, she had passed it to me with: “Take care no one sees.” Whereupon I had unfolded it and read her message, which was: “I love you.”

    “But we mustn’t sit here scribbling nonsense,” she cried, turning impetuously, with a sudden gravity of demeanour, to Andrée and Rosemonde

    “I ought to shew you the letter I got from Gisèle this morning. What an idiot I am; I’ve had it all this time in my pocket — and you can’t think how important it may be to us.” Gisèle had been moved to copy out for her friend, so that it might be passed on to the others, the essay which she had written in her certificate examination. Albertine’s fears as to the difficulty of the subjects set had been more than justified by the two from which Gisèle had had to choose. The first was: “Sophocles, from the Shades, writes to Racine to console him for the failure of Athalie“; the other: “Suppose that, after the first performance of Esther, Mme. de Sévigné is writing to Mme. de La Fayette to tell her how much she regretted her absence.” Now Gisèle, in an excess of zeal which ought to have touched the examiners’ hearts, had chosen the former, which was also the more difficult of the two subjects, and had handled it with such remarkable skill that she had been given fourteen marks, and had been congratulated by the board. She would have received her ‘mention’ if she had not ‘dried up’ in the Spanish paper. The essay, a copy of which Gisèle had now sent her, was immediately read aloud to us by Albertine, for, having presently to pass the same examination, she was anxious to have an opinion from Andrée, who was by far the cleverest of them all and might be able to give her some good ‘tips.’ “She did have a bit of luck!” was Albertine’s comment.“It’s the very subject her French mistress made her swot up while she was here.” The letter from Sophocles to Racine, as drafted by Gisèle, ran as follows: “My dear friend, You must pardon me the liberty of addressing you when I have not the honour of your personal acquaintance, but your latest tragedy, Athalie, shews, does it not, that you have made the most thorough study of my own modest works. You have not only put poetry in the mouths of the protagonists, or principal persons of the drama, but you have written other, and, let me tell you without flattery, charming verses for the choruses, a feature which was not too bad, according to all one hears, in Greek Tragedy, but is a complete novelty in France. Nay more, your talent always so fluent, so finished, so winning, so fine, so delicate, has here acquired an energy on which I congratulate you. Athalie, Joad — these are figures which your rival Corneille could have wrought no better. The characters are virile, the plot simple and strong. You have given us a tragedy in which love is not the keynote, and on this I must offer you my sincerest compliments. The most familiar proverbs are not always the truest. I will give you an example:

            ‘This passion treat, which makes the poet’s art
            Fly, as on wings, straight to the listener’s heart.’

    You have shewn us that the religious sentiment in which your choruses are steeped is no less capable of moving us. The general public may have been puzzled at first, but those who are best qualified to judge must give you your due. I have felt myself impelled to offer you all my congratulations, to which I would add, my dear brother poet, an expression of my very highest esteem.” Albertine’s eyes, while she was reading this to us, had not ceased to sparkle. “Really, you’d think she must have cribbed it somewhere!” she exclaimed, as she reached the end. “I should never have believed that Gisèle could hatch out anything like as good! And the poetry she brings in! Where on earth can she have got that from?” Albertine’s admiration, with a change, it is true, of object, but with no loss — an increase, rather — of intensity, combined with the closest attention to what was being said, continued to make her eyes ‘start from her head’ all the time that Andrée (consulted as being the biggest of the band and more knowledgeable than the others) first of all spoke of Gisèle’s essay with a certain irony, then with a levity of tone which failed to conceal her underlying seriousness proceeded to reconstruct the letter in her own way. “It is not badly done,” she told Albertine, “but if I were you and had the same subject set me, which is quite likely, as they do very often set that, I shouldn’t do it in that way. This is how I would tackle it. Well, first of all, if I had been Gisèle, I should not have let myself get tied up, I should have begun by making a rough sketch of what I was going to write on a separate piece of paper. On the top line I should state the question and give an account of the subject, then the general ideas to be worked into the development. After that, appreciation, style, conclusion. In that way, with a summary to refer to, you know where you are. But at the very start, where she begins her account of the subject, or, if you like, Titine, since it’s a letter we’re speaking of, where she comes to the matter, Gisèle has gone off the rails altogether. Writing to a person of the seventeenth century, Sophocles ought never to have said, ‘My dear friend.’” “Why, of course, she ought to have said, ‘My dear Racine,’” came impetuously from Albertine. “That would have been much better.” “No,” replied Andrée, with a trace of mockery in her tone, “she ought to have put ‘Sir.’ In the same way, to end up, she ought to have thought of something like, ‘Suffer me, Sir,’ (at the very most, ‘Dear Sir’) to inform you of the sense of high esteem with which I have the honour to be your servant.’ Then again, Gisèle says that the choruses in Athalie are a novelty. She is forgetting Esther, and two tragedies that are not much read now but happen to have been analysed this year by the Professor himself, so that you need only mention them, since he’s got them on the brain, and you’re bound to pass. I mean Les Juives, by Robert Gamier, and Montchrestien’s L’Aman.” Andrée quoted these titles without managing quite to conceal a secret sense of benevolent superiority, which found expression in a smile, quite a delightful smile, for that matter. Albertine could contain herself no — longer. “Andrée, you really are a perfect marvel,” she cried. “You must write down those names for me. Just fancy, what luck it would be if I got on to that, even in the oral, I should bring them in at once and make a colossal impression.” But in the days that followed, every time that Albertine begged Andrée just to tell her again the names of those two plays so that she might write them down, her blue-stocking friend seemed most unfortunately to have forgotten them, and left her none the wiser. “And another thing,” Andrée went on with the faintest note in her voice of scorn for companions so much younger than herself, though she relished their admiration and attached to the manner in which she herself would have composed the essay a greater importance than she wanted us to think, “Sophocles in the Shades must be kept well-informed of all that goes on. He must know, therefore, that it was not before the general public but before the King’s Majesty and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was first played. What Gisèle says in this connexion of the esteem of qualified judges is not at all bad, but she might have gone a little further. Sophocles, now that he is immortal, might quite well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire,Athalie is to be the supreme achievement not of Racine merely but of the human mind.” Albertine was drinking in every word. Her eyes blazed. And it was with the utmost indignation that she rejected Rosemonde’s suggestion that they should begin to play. “And so,” Andrée concluded, in the same easy, detached tone, blending a faint sneer with a certain warmth of conviction, “if Gisèle had noted down properly, first of all, the general ideas that she was going to develop, it might perhaps have occurred to her to do what I myself should have done, point out what a difference there is between the religious inspiration of Sophocles’s choruses and Racine’s. I should have made Sophocles remark that if Racine’s choruses are instinct with religious feeling like those of the Greek Tragedians, the gods are not the same. The God of Joad has nothing in common with the god of Sophocles. And that brings us quite naturally, when we have finished developing the subject, to our conclusion: What does it matter if their beliefs are different? Sophocles would hesitate to insist upon such a point. He would be afraid of wounding Racine’s convictions, and so, slipping in a few appropriate words on his masters at Port-Royal, he prefers to congratulate his disciple on the loftiness of his poetic genius.”

    Admiration and attention had so heated Albertine that great drops were rolling down her cheeks. Andrée preserved the unruffled calm of a female dandy. “It would not be a bad thing either to quote some of the opinions of famous critics,” she added, before they began their game. “Yes,” put in Albertine, “so I’ve been told. The best ones to quote, on the whole, are Sainte-Beuve and Merlet, aren’t they?” “Well, you’re not absolutely wrong,” Andrée told her, “Merlet and Sainte-Beuve are by no means bad. But you certainly ought to mention Deltour and Gascq-Desfossés.” She refused, however, despite Albertine’s entreaties, to write down these two unfamiliar names

    Meanwhile I had been thinking of the little page torn from a scribbling block which Albertine had handed me. “I love you,” she had written. And an hour later, as I scrambled down the paths which led back, a little too vertically for my liking, to Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my romance

    The state of being indicated by the presence of all the signs by which we are accustomed to recognise that we are in love, such as the orders which I left in the hotel not to awaken me whoever might ask to see me, unless it were one or other of the girls, the beating of my heart while I waited for her (whichever of them it might be that I was expecting) and on those mornings my fury if I had not succeeded in finding a barber to shave me, and must appear with the disfigurement of a hairy chin before Albertine, Rosemonde or Andrée, no doubt this state, recurring indifferently at the thought of one or another, was as different from what we call love as is from human life the life of the zoophytes, where an existence, an individuality, if we may term it, is divided up among several organisms. But natural history teaches us that such an organization of animal life is indeed to be observed, and that our own life, provided only that we have outgrown the first phase, is no less positive as to the reality of states hitherto unsuspected by us, through which we have to pass, and can then abandon them altogether. Such was for me this state of love divided among several girls at once. Divided — say rather undivided, for more often than not what was so delicious to me, different from the rest of the world, what was beginning to become so precious to me that the hope of finding it again on the morrow was the greatest happiness in my life, was rather the whole of the group of girls, taken as they were all together on those afternoons on the cliffs, during those lifeless hours, upon that strip of grass on which were laid those forms, so exciting to my imagination, of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée; and that without my being able to say which of them it was that made those scenes so precious to me, which of them I was most anxious to love. At the start of a new love as at its ending, we are not exclusively attached to the object of that love, but rather the desire to be loving from which it will presently emerge (and, later on, the memory which it leaves behind) wanders voluptuously through a zone of interchangeable charms — simply natural charms, it may be, gratification of appetite, enjoyment of one’s surroundings — which are so far harmonised among themselves that it does not in the presence of any one of them feel itself out of place. Besides, as my perception of them was not yet dulled by familiarity, I had still the faculty of seeing them, that is to say of feeling a profound astonishment every time that I found myself in their presence. No doubt this astonishment is to some extent due to the fact that the other person on such occasions presents himself in a fresh aspect; but so great is the multiformity of each of us, so abundant the wealth of lines of face and body, lines so few of which leave any trace, once we have parted from the other person, on the arbitrary simplicity of our memory. As our mind has selected some peculiarity that had struck us, has isolated it, exaggerated it, making of a woman who has appeared to us tall, a sketch in which her figure is absurdly elongated, or of a woman who has seemed to be pink-cheeked and golden-haired a pure ‘Harmony in pink and gold,’ so, the moment that woman is once again standing before us, all the other forgotten qualities which restore the balance of that one remembered feature at once assail us, in their confused complexity, diminishing her height, paling her cheeks, and substituting for what we have come to her solely to seek other peculiarities which we remember now that we did notice the first time, and fail to understand how we can so far have forgotten to look out for again. We thought we remembered; it was a peahen, surely; we go to see it and find a peony. And this inevitable astonishment is not the only one; for, side by side with it comes another, born of the difference, not now between the stereotyped forms of memory and reality, but between the person whom we saw last time and him who appears to us to-day from another angle and shews us another aspect. The human face is indeed, like the face of the God of some Oriental theogony, a whole cluster of faces, crowded together but on different surfaces so that one does not see them all at once

    But to a great extent our astonishment springs from the other person’s presenting to us also a face that is the same as before. It would require so immense an effort to reconstruct everything that has been imparted to us by things other than ourselves — were it only the taste of a fruit — that no sooner is the impression received than we begin imperceptibly to descend the slope of memory and, without noticing anything, in a very short time, we have come a long way from what we actually felt. So that every fresh encounter is a sort of rectification, which brings us back to what we really did see. We have no longer any recollection of this, to such an extent does what we call remembering a person consist really in forgetting him. But so long as we can still see at the moment when the forgotten aspect appears, we recognise it, we are obliged to correct the straying line; thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made so salutary and invigorating for me these daily outings with the charming damsels of the sea shore, consisted fully as much in recognition as in discovery. When there is added to this the agitation aroused by what these girls were to me, which was never quite what I had supposed, and meant that my expectancy of our next meeting resembled not so much my expectancy the time before as the still throbbing memory of our latest conversation, it will be realised that each of our excursions made a violent interruption in the course of my thoughts and moved them clean out of the direction which, in the solitude of my own room, I had been able to trace for them at my leisure. That plotted course was forgotten, had ceased to exist, when I returned home buzzing like a hive of bees with remarks which had disquieted me when I heard them and were still echoing in my brain. The other person is destroyed when we cease to see him; after which his next appearance means a fresh creation of him, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from them all. For the minimum variation that is to be found in these creations is duality. If we have in mind a strong and searching glance, a bold manner, it is inevitably, next time, by a half-languid profile, a sort of dreamy gentleness, overlooked by us in our previous impression, that we shall be, on meeting him again, astonished, that is to say almost solely struck. In confronting our memory with the new reality it is this that will mark the extent of our disappointment or surprise, will appear to us like the revised version of an earlier reality warning us that we had not remembered it correctly. In its turn, the facial aspect neglected the time before, and for that very reason the most striking this time, the most real, the most documentary, will become a matter for dreams and memories. It is a languorous and rounded profile, a gentle, dreamy expression which we shall now desire to see again. And then, next time, such resolution, such strength of character as there may be in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose, the tight lips, will come to correct the discrepancy between our desire and the object to which it has supposed itself to correspond. It is understood, of course, that this loyalty to the first and purely physical impressions which I formed afresh at each encounter with my friends did not involve only their facial appearance, since the reader has seen that I was sensible also of their voices, more disquieting still, perhaps (for not only does a voice offer the same strange and sensuous surfaces as a face, it issues from that unknown, inaccessible region the mere thought of which sets the mind swimming with unattainable kisses), their voices each like the unique sound of a little instrument into which the player put all her artistry and which was found only in her possession. Traced by a casual inflexion, a sudden deep chord in one of their voices would astonish me when I recognised after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections which after every fresh meeting I was obliged to make so as to ensure absolute accuracy were as much those of a tuner or singing-master as a draughtsman’s

    As for the harmonious cohesion in which had been neutralised for some time, by the resistance that each brought to bear against the expansion of the others, the several waves of sentiment set in motion in me by these girls, it was broken in Albertine’s favour one afternoon when we were playing the game of ‘ferret.’ It was in a little wood on the cliff. Stationed between two girls, strangers to the little band, whom the band had brought in its train because we wanted that day to have a bigger party than usual, I gazed enviously at Albertine’s neighbour, a young man, saying to myself that if I had been in his place I could have been touching my friend’s hands all those miraculous moments which might perhaps never recur, and that this would have been but the first stage in a great advance. Already, by itself, and even without the consequences which it would probably have involved, the contact of Albertine’s hands would have been delicious to me. Not that I had never seen prettier hands than hers. Even in the group of her friends, those of Andrée, slender hands and much more finely modelled, had as it were a private life of their own, obedient to the commands of their mistress, but independent, and used often to strain out before her like a leash of thoroughbred greyhounds, with lazy pauses, long dreams, sudden stretchings of a joint, seeing which Elstir had made a number of studies of these hands. And in one of them, in which you saw Andrée warming her hands at the fire, they had, with the light behind them, the gilded transparency of two autumn leaves. But, plumper than these, the hands of Albertine would yield for a moment, then resist the pressure of the hand that clasped them, giving a sensation that was quite peculiar to themselves. The act of pressing Albertine’s hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the rosy, almost mauve colouring of her skin. That pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl’s being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent as may be the cooing of doves or certain animal cries. She was the sort of woman with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilisation for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between young men and girls when they meet. If the arbitrary code of good manners had replaced the clasp of hands by some other gesture, I should have gazed, day after day, at the unattainable hands of Albertine with a curiosity to know the feel of them as ardent as was my curiosity to learn the savour of her cheeks. But in the pleasure of holding her hand unrestrictedly in mine, had I been next to her at ‘ferret’ I did not envisage that pleasure alone; what avowals, declarations silenced hitherto by my bashfulness, I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; on her side, how easy it would have been for her, in responding by other pressures, to shew me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of happiness stood open! My love would be able to make more advance in a few minutes spent thus by her side than it had yet made in all the time that I had known her. Feeling that they would last but a short time, were rapidly nearing their end, since presumably we were not going on much longer with this game, and that once it was over I should be too late, I could not keep in my place for another moment. I let myself deliberately be caught with the ring, and, having gone into the middle, when the ring passed I pretended not to see it but followed its course with my eyes, waiting for the moment when it should come into the hands of the young man next to Albertine, who herself, pealing with helpless laughter, and in the excitement and pleasure of the game, was blushing like a rose. “Why, we really are in the Fairy Wood!” said Andrée to me, pointing to the trees that grew all round, with a smile in her eyes which was meant only for me and seemed to pass over the heads of the other players, as though we two alone were clever enough to double our parts, and make, in connexion with the game we were playing, a remark of a poetic nature. She even carried the delicacy of her fancy so far as to sing half-unconsciously: “The Ferret of the Wood has passed this way, Sweet Ladies; he has passed by this way, the Ferret of Fairy Wood!” like those people who cannot visit Trianon without getting up a party in Louis XVI costume, or think in effective to have a song sung to its original setting. I should no doubt have been sorry that I could see no charm in this piece of mimicry, had I had time to think of it. But my thoughts were all elsewhere. The players began to shew surprise at my stupidity in never getting the ring. I was looking at Albertine, so pretty, so indifferent, so gay, who, though she little knew it, was to be my neighbour when at last I should catch the ring in the right hands, thanks to a stratagem which she did not suspect, and would certainly have resented if she had. In the heat of the game her long hair had become loosened, and fell in curling locks over her cheeks on which it served to intensify, by its dry brownness, the carnation pink. “You have the tresses of Laura Dianti, of Eleanor of Guyenne, and of her descendant so beloved of Chateaubriand. You ought always to wear your hair half down like that,” I murmured in her ear as an excuse for drawing close to her. Suddenly the ring passed to her neighbour. I sprang upon him at once, forced open his hands and seized it; he was obliged now to take my place inside the circle, while I took his beside Albertine. A few minutes earlier I had been envying this young man, when I saw that his hands as they slipped over the cord were constantly brushing against hers. Now that my turn was come, too shy to seek, too much moved to enjoy this contact, I no longer felt anything save the rapid and painful beating of my heart. At one moment Albertine leaned towards me, with an air of connivance, her round and rosy face, making a show of having the ring, so as to deceive the ferret, and keep him from looking in the direction in which she was just going to pass it. I realised at once that this was the sole object of Albertine’s mysterious, confidential gaze, but I was a little shocked to see thus kindle in her eyes the image — purely fictitious, invented to serve the needs of the game — of a secret, an understanding between her and myself which did not exist, but which from that moment seemed to me to be possible and would have been divinely sweet. While I was still being swept aloft by this thought, I felt a slight pressure of Albertine’s hand against mine, and her caressing finger slip under my finger along the cord, and I saw her, at the same moment, give me a wink which she tried to make pass unperceived by the others. At once, a mass of hopes, invisible hitherto by myself, crystallised within me. “She is taking advantage of the game to let me feel that she really does love me,” I thought to myself, in an acme of joy, from which no sooner had I reached it than I fell, on hearing Albertine mutter furiously: “Why can’t you take it? I’ve been shoving it at you for the last hour.” Stunned with grief, I let go the cord, the ferret saw that ring and swooped down on it, and I had to go back into the middle, where I stood helpless, in despair, looking at the unbridled rout which continued to circle round me, stung by the jeering shouts of all the players, obliged, in reply, to laugh when I had so little mind for laughter, while Albertine kept on repeating: “People can’t play if they don’t pay attention, and spoil the game for the others. He shan’t be asked again when we’re going to play, Andrée; if he is, I don’t come.” Andrée, with a mind above the game, still chanting her ‘Fairy Wood’ which, in a spirit of imitation, Rosemonde had taken up too, but without conviction, sought to make a diversion from Albertine’s reproaches by saying to me: “We’re quite close to those old Creuniers you wanted so much to see. Look, I’ll take you there by a dear little path, and we’ll leave these silly idiots to go on playing like babies in the nursery.” As Andrée was extremely nice to me, as we went along I said to her everything about Albertine that seemed calculated to make me attractive to the latter. Andrée replied that she too was very fond of Albertine, thought her charming; in spite of which the compliments that I was paying to her friend did not seem altogether to please her. Suddenly, in the little sunken path, I stopped short, touched to the heart by an exquisite memory of my childhood. I had just recognised, by the fretted and glossy leaves which it thrust out towards me, a hawthorn-bush, flowerless, alas, now that spring was over. Around me floated the atmosphere of far-off Months of Mary, of Sunday afternoons, of beliefs, or errors long ago forgotten. I wanted to stay it in its passage. I stood still for a moment, and Andrée, with a charming divination of what was in my mind, left me to converse with the leaves of the bush. I asked them for news of the flowers, those hawthorn flowers that were like merry little girls, headstrong, provocative, pious. “The young ladies have been gone from here for a long time now,” the leaves told me. And perhaps they thought that, for the great friend of those young ladies that I pretended to be, I seemed to have singularly little knowledge of their habits. A great friend, but one who had never been to see them again for all these years, despite his promises. And yet, as Gilberte had been my first love among girls, so these had been my first love among flowers. “Yes, I know all that, they leave about the middle of June,” I answered, “but I am so delighted to see the place where they stayed when they were here. They came to see me, too, at Combray, in my room; my mother brought them when I was ill in bed. And we used to meet on Saturday evenings, too, at the Month of Mary devotions. Can they get to them from here?” “Oh, of course! Why, they make a special point of having our young ladies at Saint-Denis du Désert, the church near here.” “Then, if I want to see them now?” “Oh, not before May, next year.” “But I can be sure that they will be here?” “They come regularly every year.” “Only I don’t know whether it will be easy to find the place.” “Oh, dear, yes! They are so gay, the young ladies, they stop laughing only to sing hymns together, so that you can’t possibly miss them, you can tell by the scent from the other end of the path.”

    I caught up Andrée, and began again to sing Albertine’s praises. It was inconceivable to me that she would not repeat what I said to her friend, seeing the emphasis that I put into it. And yet I never heard that Albertine had been told. Andrée had, nevertheless, a far greater understanding of the things of the heart, a refinement of nice behaviour; finding the look, the word, the action that could most ingeniously give pleasure, keeping to herself a remark that might possibly cause pain, making a sacrifice (and making it as though it were no sacrifice at all) of an afternoon’s play, or it might be an ‘at home’ or a garden party in order to stay beside a friend who was feeling sad, and thus shew him or her that she preferred the simple company of a friend to frivolous pleasures; these were her habitual delicacies. But when one knew her a little better one would have said that it was with her as with those heroic cravens who wish not to be afraid, and whose bravery is especially meritorious, one would have said that in her true character there was none of that generosity which she displayed at every moment out of moral distinction, or sensibility, or a noble desire to shew herself a true friend. When I listened to all the charming things she was saying to me about a possible affection between Albertine and myself it seemed as though she were bound to do everything in her power to bring it to pass. Whereas, by mere chance perhaps, not even of the least of the various minor opportunities which were at her disposal and might have proved effective in uniting me to Albertine did she ever make any use, and I would not swear that my effort to make myself loved by Albertine did not — if not provoke in her friend secret stratagems destined to bring it to nought — at any rate arouse in her an anger which however she took good care to hide and against which even, in her delicacy of feeling, she may herself have fought. Of the countless refinements of goodness which Andrée shewed Albertine would have been incapable, and yet I was not certain of the underlying goodness of the former as I was to be, later on, of the latter’s. Shewing herself always tenderly indulgent to the exuberant frivolity of Albertine, Andrée would greet her with speeches, with smiles which were those of a friend, better still, she always acted towards her as a friend. I have seen her, day after day, in order to give the benefit of her own wealth, to bring some happiness to this penniless friend take, without any possibility of advantage to herself, more pains than a courtier would take who sought to win his sovereign’s favour. She was charmingly gentle always, charming in her choice of sweet, pathetic expressions, when you said to her what a pity it was that Albertine was so poor, and took infinitely more trouble on her behalf than she would have taken for a wealthy friend. But if anyone were to hint that Albertine was perhaps not quite so poor as people made out, a just discernible cloud would veil the light of Andrée’s eyes and brow; she seemed out of temper. And if you went on to say that after all Albertine might perhaps be less difficult to marry off than people supposed, she would vehemently contradict you, repeating almost angrily: “Oh dear, no; she will never get married! I am quite certain of it; it is a dreadful worry to me!” In so far as I myself was concerned, Andrée was the only one of the girls who would never have repeated to me anything not very pleasant that might have been said about me by a third person; more than that, if it were I who told her what had been said she would make a pretence of not believing it, or would furnish some explanation which made the remark inoffensive; it is the aggregate of these qualities that goes by the name of tact. Tact is the attribute of those people who, if we have called a man out in a duel, congratulate us and add that there was no necessity, really; so as to enhance still further in our own eyes the courage of which we have given proof without having been forced to do lo. They are the opposite of the people who, in similar circumstances, say: “It must have been a horrid nuisance for you, fighting a duel, but on the other hand you couldn’t possibly swallow an insult like that, there was nothing else to be done.” But as there, is always something to be said on both sides, if the pleasure, or at least the indifference shewn by our friends in repeating something offensive that they have heard said about us, proves that they do not exactly put themselves in our skin at the moment of speaking, but thrust in the pin-point, turn the knife-blade as though it were gold-beater’s skin and not human, the art of always keeping hidden from us what might be disagreeable to us in what they have heard said about our actions, or in the opinion which those actions have led the speakers themselves to form of us, proves that there is in the other kind of friends, in the friends who are so full of tact, a strong vein of dissimulation. It does no harm if indeed they are incapable of thinking evil, and if what is said by other people only makes them suffer as it would make us. I supposed this to be the case with Andrée, without, however, being absolutely sure

    We had left the little wood and had followed a network of overgrown paths through which Andrée managed to find her way with great skill. Suddenly, “Look now,” she said to me, “there are your famous Creuniers, and, I say, you are in luck, it’s just the time of day, and the light is the same as when Elstir painted them.” But I was still too wretched at having fallen, during the game of ‘ferret,’ from such a pinnacle of hopes. And so it was not with the pleasure which otherwise I should doubtless have felt that I caught sight, almost below my feet, crouching among the rocks, where they had gone for protection from the heat, of marine goddesses for whom Elstir had lain in wait and surprised them there, beneath a dark glaze as lovely as Leonardo would have painted, the marvellous Shadows, sheltered and furtive, nimble and voiceless, ready at the first glimmer of light to slip behind the stone, to hide in a cranny, and prompt, once the menacing ray had passed, to return to rock or seaweed beneath the sun that crumbled the cliffs and the colourless ocean, over whose slumbers they seemed to be watching, motionless lightfoot guardians letting appear on the water’s surface their viscous bodies and the attentive gaze of their deep blue eyes

    We went back to the wood to pick up the other girls and go home together. I knew now that I was in love with Albertine; but, alas! I had no thought of letting her know it. This was because, since the days of our games in the Champs-Elysées, my conception of love had become different, even if the persons to whom my love was successively assigned remained practically the same. For one thing, the avowal, the declaration of my passion to her whom I loved no longer seemed to me one of the vital and necessary incidents of love, nor love itself an external reality, but simply a subjective pleasure. And as for this pleasure, I felt that Albertine would do everything necessary to furnish it, all the more since she would not know that I was enjoying it

    As we walked home the image of Albertine, bathed in the light that streamed from the other girls, was not the only one that existed for me. But as the moon, which is no more than a tiny white cloud of a more definite and fixed shape than other clouds during the day, assumes her full power as soon as daylight dies, so when I was once more in the hotel it was Albertine’s sole image that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room seemed to me to have become suddenly a new place. Of course, for a long time past, it had not been the hostile room of my first night in it. All our lives we go on patiently modifying the surroundings in which we dwell; and gradually, as habit dispenses us from feeling them, we suppress the noxious elements of colour, shape and smell which were at the root of our discomfort. Nor was it any longer the room, still potent enough over my sensibility, not certainly to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the fount of summer days, like a marble basin in which, half way up its polished sides, they mirrored an azure surface steeped in light over which glided for an instant, impalpable and white as a wave of heat, a shadowy and fleeting cloud; not the room, wholly aesthetic, of the pictorial evening hours; it was the room in which I had been now for so many days that I no longer saw it. And now I was just beginning again to open my eyes to it, but this time from the selfish angle which is that of love. I liked to feel that the fine big mirror across one corner, the handsome bookcases with their fronts of glass would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good impression of myself. Instead of a place of transit in which I would stay for a few minutes before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me, fashioned itself anew, for I looked at and appreciated each article of its furniture with the eyes of Albertine

    A few days after the game of ‘ferret,’ when, having allowed ourselves to wander rather too far afield, we had been fortunate in finding at Maine-ville a couple of little “tubs” with two seats in each which would enable us to be back in time for dinner, the keenness, already intense, of my love for Albertine, had the following effect, first of all, that it was Rosemonde and Andrée in turn that I invited to be my companion, and never once Albertine, after which, in spite of my manifest preference for Andrée or Rosemonde, I led everybody, by secondary considerations of time and distance, cloaks and so forth, to decide, as though against my wishes, that the most practical policy was that I should take Albertine, to whose company I pretended to resign myself for good or ill. Unfortunately, since love tends to the complete assimilation of another person, while other people are not comestible by way of conversation alone, Albertine might be (and indeed was) as friendly as possible to me on our way home; when I had deposited her at her own door she left me happy but more famished for her even than I had been at the start, and reckoning the moments that we had spent together as only à prelude, of little importance in itself, to those that were still to come. And yet this prelude had that initial charm which is not to be found again. I had not yet asked anything of Albertine. She could imagine what I wanted, but, not being certain of it, would suppose that I was tending only towards relations without any definite purpose, in which my friend would find that delicious vagueness, rich in surprising fulfilments of expectations, which is true romance

    In the week that followed I scarcely attempted to see Albertine. I made a show of preferring Andrée. Love is born; one would like to remain, for her whom one loves, the unknown whom she may love in turn, but one has need of her, one requires contact not so much with her body as with her attention, her heart. One slips into a letter some spiteful expression which will force the indifferent reader to ask for some little kindness in compensation, and love, following an unvarying procedure, sets going with an alternating movement the machinery in which one can no longer either refrain from loving or be loved. I gave to Andrée the hours spent by the others at a party which I knew that she would sacrifice for my sake, with pleasure, and would have sacrificed even with reluctance, from a moral nicety, so as not to let either the others or herself think that she attached any importance to a relatively frivolous amusement. I arranged in this way to have her entirely to myself every evening, meaning not to make Albertine jealous, but to improve my position in her eyes, or at any rate not to imperil it by letting Albertine know that it was herself and not Andrée that I loved. Nor did I confide this to Andrée either, lest she should repeat it to her friend. When I spoke of Albertine to Andrée I affected a coldness by which she was perhaps less deceived that I by her apparent credulity. She made a show of believing in my indifference to Albertine, of desiring the closest possible union between Albertine and myself. It is probable that, on the contrary, she neither believed in the one nor wished for the other. While I was saying to her that I did not care very greatly for her friend, I was thinking of one thing only, how to become acquainted with Mme. Bontemps, who was staying for a few days near Balbec, and to whom Albertine was going presently on a short visit. Naturally I did not let Andrée become aware of this desire, and when I spoke to her of Albertine’s people, it was in the most careless manner possible. Andrée’s direct answers did not appear to throw any doubt on my sincerity. Why then did she blurt out suddenly, about that time: “Oh, guess who’ I’ve just seen — Albertine’s aunt!” It is true that she had not said in so many words: “I could see through your casual remarks all right that the one thing you were really thinking of was how you could make friends with Albertine’s aunt.” But it was clearly to the presence in Andrée’s mind of some such idea which she felt it more becoming to keep from me that the word ‘just’ seemed to point. It was of a kind with certain glances, certain gestures which, for all that they have not a form that is logical, rational, deliberately calculated to match the listener’s intelligence, reach him nevertheless in their true significance, just as human speech, converted into electricity in the telephone, is turned into speech again when it strikes the ear. In order to remove from Andree’s mind the idea that I was interested in Mme. Bontemps, I spoke of her from that time onwards not only carelessly but with downright malice, saying that I had once met that idiot of a woman, and trusted I should never have that experience again. Whereas I was seeking by every means in my power to meet her

    tried to induce Elstir (but without mentioning to anyone else that I had asked him) to speak to her about me and to bring us together. He promised to introduce me to her, though he seemed greatly surprised at my wishing it, for he regarded her as a contemptible woman, a born intriguer, as little interesting as she was disinterested. Reflecting that if I did see Mme. Bontemps, Andrée would be sure to hear of it sooner or later, I thought it best to warn her in advance. “The things one tries hardest to avoid are what one finds one cannot escape,” I told her. “Nothing in the world could bore me so much as meeting Mme. Bontemps again, and yet I can’t get out of it, Elstir has arranged to invite us together.” “I have never doubted it for a single instant,” exclaimed Andrée in a bitter tone, while her eyes, enlarged and altered by her annoyance, focussed themselves upon some invisible object. These words of Andree’s were not the most recent statement of a thought which might be expressed thus: “I know that you are in love with Albertine, and that you are working day and night to get in touch with her people.” But they were the shapeless fragments, easily pieced together again by me, of some such thought which I had exploded by striking it, through the shield of Andree’s self-control. Like her ‘just,’ these words had no meaning save in the second degree, that is to say they were words of the sort which (rather than direct affirmatives) inspires in us respect or distrust for another person, and leads to a rupture

    If Andrée had not believed me when I told her that Albertine’s relatives left me indifferent, that was because she thought that I was in love with Albertine. And probably she was none too happy in the thought

    She was generally present as a third party at my meetings with her friend. And yet there were days when I was to see Albertine by herself, days to which I looked forward with feverish impatience, which passed without bringing me any decisive result, without having, any of them, been that cardinal day whose part I immediately entrusted to the day that was to follow, which would prove no more apt to play it; thus there crumbled and collapsed, one after another, like waves of the sea, those peaks at once replaced by others

    About a month after the day on which we had played ‘ferret’ together, I learned that Albertine was going away next morning to spend a couple of days with Mme. Bontemps, and, since she would have to start early, was coming to sleep that night at the Grand Hotel, from which, by taking the omnibus, she would be able, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, to catch the first train in the morning. I mentioned this to Andrée. “I don’t believe a word of it,” she replied, with a look of annoyance. “Anyhow it won’t help you at all, for I’m quite sure Albertine won’t want to see you if she goes to the hotel by herself. It wouldn’t be ‘regulation,’” she added, employing an epithet which had recently come into favour with her, in the sense of ‘what is done.’ “I tell you this because I understand Albertine. What difference do you suppose it makes to me, whether you see her or not? Not the slightest, I can assure you!”

    We were joined by Octave who had no hesitation in telling Andrée the number of strokes he had gone round in, the day before, at golf, then by Albertine, counting her diabolo as she walked along, like a nun telling her beads. Thanks to this pastime she could be left alone for hours on end without growing bored. As soon as she joined us I became conscious of the obstinate tip of her nose, which I had omitted from my mental pictures of her during the last few days; beneath her dark hair the vertical front of her brow controverted — and not for the first time — the indefinite image that I had preserved of her, while its whiteness made a vivid splash in my field of vision; emerging from the dust of memory, Albertine was built up afresh before my eyes. Golf gives one a taste for solitary pleasures. The pleasure to be derived from diabolo is undoubtedly one of these. And yet, after she had joined us, Albertine continued to toss up and catch her missile, just as a lady on whom friends have come to call does not on their account stop working at her crochet. “I hear that Mme. de Villeparisis,” she remarked to Octave, “has been complaining to your father.” I could hear, underlying the word, one of those notes that were peculiar to Albertine; always, just as I had made certain that I had forgotten them, I would be reminded of a glimpse caught through them before of Albertine’s determined and typically Gallic mien. I might have been blind, and yet have detected certain of her qualities, alert and slightly provincial, from those notes, just as plainly as from the tip of her nose. These were equivalent and might have been substituted for one another, and her voice was like what we are promised in the photo-telephone of the future; the visual image was clearly outlined in the sound. “She’s not written only to your father, either, she wrote to the Mayor of Balbec at the same time, to say that we must stop playing diabolo on the ‘front’ as somebody hit her in the face with one.” “Yes, I was hearing about that. It’s too silly. There’s little enough to do here as it is.” Andrée did not join in the conversation; she was not acquainted, any more than was Albertine or Octave, with Mme. de Villeparisis. She did, however, remark: “I can’t think why this lady should make such a song about it. O’d Mme. de Cambremer got hit in the face, and she never complained.” “I will explain the difference,” replied Octave gravely, striking a match as he spoke. “It’s my belief that Mme. de Cambremer is a woman of the world, and Mme. de Villeparisis is just an upstart. Are you playing golf this afternoon?” And he left us, followed by Andrée. I was alone now with Albertine. “Do you see,” she began, “I’m wearing my hair now the way you like — look at my ringlet. They all laugh at me and nobody knows who’ I’m doing it for. My aunt will laugh at me too. But I shan’t tell her why, either.” I had a sidelong view of Albertine’s cheeks, which often appeared pale, but, seen thus, were flushed with a coursing stream of blood which lighted them up, gave them that dazzling clearness which certain winter mornings have when the stones sparkling in the sun seem blocks of pink granite and radiate joy. The joy that I was drawing at this moment from the sight of Albertine’s cheeks was equally keen, but led to another desire on my part, which was not to walk with her but to take her in my arms. I asked her if the report of her plans which I had heard were correct. “Yes,” she told me, “I shall be sleeping at your hotel to-night, and in fact as I’ve got rather a chill, I shall be going to bed before dinner. You can come and sit by my bed and watch me eat, if you like, and afterwards we’ll play at anything you choose. I should have liked you to come to the station to-morrow morning, but I’m afraid it might look rather odd, I don’t say to Andrée, who is a sensible person, but to the others who will be there; if my aunt got to know, I should never hear the last of it. But we can spend the evening together, at any rate. My aunt will know nothing about that. I must go and say good-bye to Andrée. So long, then. Come early, so that we can have a nice long time together,” she added, smiling. At these words I was swept back past the days in which I loved Gilberte to those in which love seemed to me not only an external entity but one that could be realised as a whole. Whereas the Gilberte whom I used to see in the Champs-Elysées was a different Gilberte from the one whom I found waiting inside myself when I was alone again, suddenly in the real Albertine, her whom I saw every day, whom I supposed to be stuffed with middle-class prejudices and entirely open with her aunt, there was incarnate the imaginary Albertine, she whom, when I still did not know her, I had suspected of casting furtive glances at myself on the ‘front,’ she who had worn an air of being reluctant to go indoors when she saw me making off in the other direction

    I went in to dinner with my grandmother. I felt within me a secret which she could never guess. Similarly with Albertine; to-morrow her friends would be with her, not knowing what novel experience she and I had in common; and when she kissed her niece on the brow Mme. Bontemps would never imagine that I stood between them, in that arrangement of Albertine’s hair which had for its object, concealed from all the world, to give me pleasure, me who had until then so greatly envied Mme. Bontemps because, being related to the same people as her niece, she had the same occasions to don mourning, the same family visits to pay; and now I found myself meaning more to Albertine than did the aunt herself. When she was with her aunt, it was of me that she would be thinking. What was going to happen that evening, I scarcely knew. In any event, the Grand Hotel, the evening, would no longer seem empty to me; they contained my happiness. I rang for the lift-boy to take me up to the room which Albertine had engaged, a room that looked over the valley. The slightest movements, such as that of sitting down on the bench in the lift, were satisfying, because they were in direct relation to my heart; I saw in the ropes that drew the cage upwards, in the few steps that I had still to climb, only a materialisation of the machinery, the stages of my joy. I had only two or three steps to take now along the corridor before coming to that room in which was enshrined the precious substance of that rosy form — that room which, even if there were to be done in it delicious things, would keep that air of permanence, of being, to a chance visitor who knew nothing of its history, just like any other room, which makes of inanimate things the obstinately mute witnesses, the scrupulous confidants, the inviolable depositaries of our pleasure. Those few steps from the landing to Albertine’s door, those few steps which no one now could prevent my taking, I took with delight, with prudence, as though plunged into a new and strange element, as if in going forward I had been gently displacing the liquid stream of happiness, and at the same time with a strange feeling of absolute power, and of entering at length into an inheritance which had belonged to me from all time. Then suddenly I reflected that it was wrong to be in any doubt; she had told me to come when she was in bed. It was as clear as daylight; I pranced for joy, I nearly knocked over Françoise who was standing in my way, I ran, with glowing eyes, towards my friend’s room. I found Albertine in bed. Leaving her throat bare, her white nightgown altered the proportions of her face, which, flushed by being in bed or by her cold or by dinner, seemed pinker than before; I thought of the colours which I had had, a few hours earlier, displayed beside me, on the ‘front,’ the savour of which I was now at last to taste; her cheek was crossed obliquely by one of those long, dark, curling tresses, which, to please me, she had undone altogether. She looked at me and smiled. Beyond her, through the window, the valley lay bright beneath the moon. The sight of Albertine’s bare throat, of those strangely vivid cheeks, had so intoxicated me (that is to say had placed the reality of the world for me no longer in nature, but in the torrent of my sensations which it was all I could do to keep within bounds), as to have destroyed the balance between the life, immense and indestructible, which circulated in my being, and the life of the universe, so puny in comparison. The sea, which was visible through the window as well as the valley, the swelling breasts of the first of the Maineville cliffs, the sky in which the moon had not yet climbed to the zenith, all of these seemed less than a featherweight on my eyeballs, which between their lids I could feel dilated, resisting, ready to bear very different burdens, all the mountains of the world upon their fragile surface. Their orbit no longer found even the sphere of the horizon adequate to fill it. And everything that nature could have brought me of life would have seemed wretchedly meagre, the sigh of the waves far too short a sound to express the enormous aspiration that was surging in my breast. I bent over Albertine to kiss her. Death might have struck me down in that moment; it would have seemed to me a trivial, or rather an impossible thing, for life was not outside, it was in me; I should have smiled pityingly had a philosopher then expressed the idea that some day, even some distant day, I should have to die, that the external forces of nature would survive me, the forces of that nature beneath whose godlike feet I was no more than a grain of dust; that, after me, there would still remain those rounded, swelling cliffs, that sea, that moonlight and that sky! How was that possible; how could the world last longer than myself, since it was it that was enclosed in me, in me whom it went a long way short of filling, in me, where, feeling that there was room to store so many other treasures, I flung contemptuously into a corner sky, sea and cliffs. “Stop that, or I’ll ring the bell!” cried Albertine, seeing that I was flinging myself upon her to kiss her. But I reminded myself that it was not for no purpose that a girl made a young man come to her room in secret, arranging that her aunt should not know — that boldness, moreover, rewards those who know how to seize their opportunities; in the state of exaltation in which I was, the round face of Albertine, lighted by an inner flame, like the glass bowl of a lamp, started into such prominence that, copying the rotation of a burning sphere, it seemed to me to be turning, like those faces of Michelangelo which are being swept past in the arrested headlong flight of a whirlwind. I was going to learn the fragrance, the flavour which this strange pink fruit concealed. I heard a sound, precipitous, prolonged, shrill. Albertine had pulled the bell with all her might

    * * *

    I had supposed that the love which I felt for Albertine was not based on the hope of carnal possession. And yet, when the lesson to be drawn from my experience that evening was, apparently, that such possession was impossible; when, after having had not the least doubt, that first day, on the beach, of Albertine’s being unchaste, and having then passed through various intermediate assumptions, I seemed to have quite definitely reached the conclusion that she was absolutely virtuous; when, on her return from her aunt’s, a week later, she greeted me coldly with: “I forgive you; in fact I’m sorry to have upset you, but you must never do it again,”— then, in contrast to what I had felt on learning from Bloch that one could always have all the women one liked, and as if, in place of a real girl, I had known a wax doll, it came to pass that gradually there aetached itself from her my desire to penetrate into her life, to follow her through the places in which she had spent her childhood, to be initiated by her into the athletic life; my intellectual curiosity to know what were her thoughts on this subject or that did not survive my belief that I might take her in my arms if I chose. My dreams abandoned her, once they had ceased to be nourished by the hope of a possession of which I had supposed them to be independent. Thenceforward they found themselves once more at liberty to transmit themselves, according to the attraction that I had found in her on any particular day, above all according to the chances that I seemed to detect of my being, possibly, one day, loved by her — to one or another of Albertine’s friends, and to Andrée first of all. And yet, if Albertine had not existed, perhaps I should not have had the pleasure which I began to feel more and more strongly during the days that followed in the kindness that was shewn me by Andrée. Albertine told no one of the check which I had received at her hands. She was one of those pretty girls who, from their earliest youth, by their beauty, but especially by an attraction, a charm which remains somewhat mysterious and has its source perhaps in reserves of vitality to which others less favoured by nature come to quench their thirst, have always — in their home circle, among their friends, in society — proved more attractive than other more beautiful and richer girls; she was one of those people from whom, before the age of love and ever so much more after it is reached, one asks more than they ask in return, more even than they are able to give. From her childhood Albertine had always had round her in an adoring circle four or five little girl friends, among them Andrée who was so far her superior and knew it (and perhaps this attraction which Albertine exerted quite involuntarily had been the origin, had laid the foundations of the little band). This attraction was still potent even at a great social distance, in circles quite brilliant in comparison, where if there was a pavane to be danced, they would send for Albertine rather than have it danced by another girl of better family. The consequence was that, not having a penny to her name, living a hard enough life, moreover, on the hands of M. Bontemps, who was said to be ‘on the rocks,’ and was anyhow anxious to be rid of her, she was nevertheless invited, not only to dine but to stay, by people who, in Saint-Loup’s sight, might not have had any distinction, but to Rosemonde’s mother or Andrée’s, women who though very rich themselves did not know these other and richer people, represented something quite incalculable. Thus Albertine spent a few weeks every year with the family of one of the Governors of the Bank of France, who was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of a great Railway Company. The wife of this financier entertained people of importance, and had never mentioned her ‘day’ to Andrée’s mother, who thought her wanting in politeness, but was nevertheless prodigiously interested in everything that went on in her house. Accordingly she encouraged Andrée every year to invite Albertine down to their villa, because, as she said, it was a real charity to offer a holiday by the sea to a girl who had not herself the means to travel and whose aunt did so little for her; Andrée’s mother was probably not prompted by the thought that the banker and his wife, learning that Albertine was made much of by her and her daughter, would form a high opinion of them both; still less did she hope that Albertine, good and clever as she was, would manage to get her invited, or at least to get Andrée invited, to the financier’s garden-parties. But every evening at the dinner-table, while she assumed an air of indifference slightly tinged with contempt, she was fascinated by Albertine’s accounts of everything that had happened at the big house while she was staying there, and the names of the other guests, almost all of them people whom she knew by sight or by name. True, the thought that she knew them only in this indirect fashion, that is to say did not know them at all (she called this kind of acquaintance knowing people ‘all my life’), gave Andrée’s mother a touch of melancholy while she plied Albertine with questions about them in a lofty and distant tone, speaking with closed lips, and might have left her doubtful and uneasy as to the importance of her own social position had she not been able to reassure herself, to return safely to the ‘realities of life,’ by saying to the butler: “Please tell the chef that he has not made the peas soft enough.” She then recovered her serenity. And she was quite determined that Andrée was to marry nobody but a man — of the best family, of course — rich enough for her too to be able to keep a chef and a couple of coachmen. This was the proof positive, the practical indication of ‘position.’ But the fact that Albertine had dined at the banker’s house in the country with this or that great lady, and that the said great lady had invited the girl to stay with her next winter, did not invalidate a sort of special consideration which Albertine shewed towards Andrée’s mother, which went very well with the pity, and even repulsion, excited by the tale of her misfortunes, a repulsion increased by the fact that M. Bontemps had proved a traitor to the cause (he was even, people said, vaguely Panamist) and had rallied to the Government. Not that this deterred Andrée’s mother, in her passion for abstract truth, from withering with her scorn the people who appeared to believe that Albertine was of humble origin. “What’s that you say? Why, they’re one of the best families in the country. Simonet with a single ‘n,’ you know!” Certainly, in view of the class of society in which all this went on, in which money plays so important a part, and mere charm makes people ask you out but not marry you, a ‘comfortable’ marriage did not appear to be for Albertine a practical outcome of the so distinguished patronage which she enjoyed but which would not have been held to compensate for her poverty. But even by themselves, and with no prospect of any matrimonial consequence, Albertine’s ‘successes’ in society excited the envy of certain spiteful mothers, furious at seeing her received like one of the family by the banker’s wife, even by Andrée’s mother, neither of whom they themselves really knew. They therefore went about telling common friends of those ladies and their own that both ladies would be very angry if they knew the facts, which were that Albertine repeated to each of them everything that the intimacy to which she was rashly admitted enabled her to spy out in the household of the other, a thousand little secrets which it must be infinitely unpleasant to the interested party to have made public. These envious women said this so that it might be repeated and might get Albertine into trouble with her patrons. But, as often happens, their machinations met with no success. The spite that prompted them was too apparent, and their only result was to make the women who had planned them appear rather more contemptible than before. Andrée’s mother was too firm in her opinion of Albertine to change her mind about her now. She looked upon her as a ‘poor wretch,’ but the best-natured girl living, and one who would do anything in the world to give pleasure

    If this sort of select popularity to which Albertine had attained did not seem likely to lead to any practical result, it had stamped Andrée’s friend with the distinctive marks of people who, being always sought after, have never any need to offer themselves, marks (to be found also, and for analogous reasons, at the other end of the social scale among the leaders of fashion) which consist in their not making any display of the successes they have scored, but rather keeping them to themselves. She would never say to anyone: “So-and-so is anxious to meet me,” would speak of everyone with the greatest good nature, and as if it had been she who ran after, who sought to know other people, and not they. If you spoke of a young man who, a few minutes earlier, had been, in private conversation with her, heaping the bitterest reproaches upon her because she had refused him an assignation, so far from proclaiming this in public, or betraying any resentment she would stand up for him: “He is such a nice boy!” Indeed it quite annoyed her when she attracted people, because that compelled her to disappoint them, whereas her natural instinct was always to give pleasure. So much did she enjoy giving pleasure that she had come to employ a particular kind of falsehood, found among utilitarians and men who have ‘arrived.’ Existing besides in an embryonic state in a vast number of people, this form of insincerity consists in not being able to confine the pleasure arising out of a single act of politeness to a single person. For instance, if Albertine’s aunt wished her niece to accompany her to a party which was not very lively, Albertine might have found it sufficient to extract from the incident the moral profit of having given pleasure to her aunt. But being courteously welcomed by her host and hostess, she thought it better to say to them that she had been wanting to see them for so long that she had finally seized this opportunity and begged her aunt to take her to their party. Even this was not enough: at the same party there happened to be one of Albertine’s friends who was in great distress. “I did not like the idea of your being here by yourself. I thought it might do you good to have me with you. If you would rather come away from here, go somewhere else, I am ready to do anything you like; all I want is to see you look not so sad.”— Which, as it happened, was true also. Sometimes it happened however that the fictitious object destroyed the real. Thus, Albertine, having a favour to ask on behalf of one of her friends, went on purpose to see a certain lady who could help her. But on arriving at the house of this lady — a kind and sympathetic soul — the girl, unconsciously following the principle of utilising a single action in a number of ways, felt it to be more ingratiating to appear to have come there solely on account of the pleasure she knew she would derive from seeing the lady again. The lady was deeply touched that Albertine should have taken a long journey purely out of friendship for herself. Seeing her almost overcome by emotion, Albertine began to like the lady still better. Only, there was this awkward consequence: she now felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship which she pretended to have been her motive in coming, that she was afraid of making the lady suspect the genuineness of sentiments which were actually quite sincere if she now asked her to do the favour, whatever it may have been, for her friend. The lady would think that Albertine had come for that purpose, which was true, but would conclude also that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was not. With the result that she came away without having asked the favour, like a man sometimes who has been so good to a woman, in the hope of winning her, that he refrains from declaring his passion in order to preserve for his goodness an air of nobility. In other instances it would be wrong to say that the true object was sacrificed to the subordinate and subsequently conceived idea, but the two were so far incompatible that if the person to whom Albertine endeared herself by stating the second had known of the existence of the first, his pleasure would at once have been turned into the deepest annoyance. At a much later point in this story, we shall have occasion to see this kind of incompatibility expressed in clearer terms. Let us say for the present, borrowing an example of a completely different order, that they occur very frequently in the most divergent situations that life has to offer. A husband has established his mistress in the town where he is quartered with his regiment. His wife, left by herself in Paris, and with an inkling of the truth, grows more and more miserable, and writes her husband letters embittered by jealousy. Very well; the mistress is obliged to go up to Paris for the day. The husband cannot resist her entreaties that he will go with her, and applies for short leave, which is granted. But as he is a good-natured fellow, and hates to make his wife unhappy, he goes to her and tells her, shedding a few quite genuine tears, that, driven to desperation by her letters, he has found the means of getting away from his duties to come to her, to console her in his arms. He has thus contrived by a single journey to furnish wife and mistress alike with proofs of his affection. But if the wife were to learn the reason for which he has come to Paris, her joy would doubtless be turned into grief, unless her pleasure in seeing the faithless wretch outweighed, in spite of everything, the pain that his infidelities had caused her. Among the men who have struck me as practising with most perseverance this system of what might be called killing any number of birds with one stone, must be included M. de Norpois. He would now and then agree to act as intermediary between two of his friends who had quarrelled, which led to his being called the most obliging of men. But it was not sufficient for him to appear to be doing a service to the friend who had come to him to demand it; he would represent to the other the steps which he was taking to effect a reconciliation as undertaken not at the request of the first friend but in the interest of the second, an attitude of the sincerity of which he had never any difficulty in convincing a listener already influenced by the idea that he saw before him the ‘most serviceable of men.’ In this fashion, playing in two scenes turn about, what in stage parlance is called ‘doubling’ two parts, he never allowed his influence to be in the slightest degree imperilled, and the services which he rendered constituted not an expenditure of capital but a dividend upon some part of his credit. At the same time every service, seemingly rendered twice over, correspondingly enhanced his reputation as an obliging friend, and, better still, a friend whose interventions were efficacious, one who did not draw bows at a venture, whose efforts were always justified by success, as was shewn by the gratitude of both parties. This duplicity in rendering services was — allowing for disappointments such as are the lot of every human being — an important element of M. de Norpois’s character. And often at the Ministry he would make use of my father, who was a simple soul, while making him believe that it was he, M. de Norpois, who was being useful to my father. Attracting people more easily than she wished, and having no need to proclaim her conquests abroad, Albertine kept silence with regard to the scene with myself by her bedside, which a plain girl would have wished the whole world to know. And yet of her attitude during that scene I could not arrive at any satisfactory explanation. Taking first of all the supposition that she was absolutely chaste (a supposition with which I had originally accounted for the violence with which Albertine had refused to let herself be taken in my arms and kissed, though it was by no means essential to my conception of the goodness, the fundamentally honourable character of my friend), I could not accept it without a copious revision of its terms. It ran so entirely counter to the hypothesis which I had constructed that day when I saw Albertine for the first time. Then ever so many different acts, all acts of kindness towards myself (a kindness that was caressing, at times uneasy, alarmed, jealous of my predilection for Andrée) came up on all sides to challenge the brutal gesture with which, to escape from me, she had pulled the bell. Why then had she invited me to come and spend the evening by her bedside? Why had she spoken all the time in the language of affection? What object is there in your desire to see a friend, in your fear that he is fonder of another of your friends than of you; why seek to give him pleasure, why tell him, so romantically, that the others will never know that he has spent the evening in your room, if you refuse him so simple a pleasure and if to you it is no pleasure at all? I could not believe, all the same, that Albertine’s chastity was carried to such a pitch as that, and I had begun to ask myself whether her violence might not have been due to some reason of coquetry, a disagreeable odour, for instance, which she suspected of lingering about her person, and by which she was afraid that I might be disgusted, or else of cowardice, if for instance she imagined, in her ignorance of the facts of love, that my state of nervous exhaustion was due to something contagious, communicable to her in a kiss. She was genuinely distressed by her failure to afford me pleasure, and gave me a little gold pencil-case, with that virtuous perversity which people shew who, moved by your supplications and yet not consenting to grant you what those supplications demand, are anxious all the same to bestow on you some mark of their affection; the critic, an article from whose pen would so gratify the novelist, asks him instead to dinner; the duchess does not take the snob with her to the theatre but lends him her box on an evening when she will not be using it herself. So far are those who do least for us, and might easily do nothing, driven by conscience to do something. I told Albertine that in giving me this pencil-case she was affording me great pleasure, and yet not so great as I should have felt if, on the night she had spent at the hotel, she had permitted me to embrace her. “It would have made me so happy; what possible harm could it have done you? I was simply astounded at your refusing to let me do it.” “What astounds me,” she retorted, “is that you should have thought it astounding. Funny sort of girls you must know if my behaviour surprises you.” “I am extremely sorry if I annoyed you, but even now I cannot say that I think I was in the wrong. What I feel is that all that sort of thing is of no importance, really, and I can’t understand a girl who could so easily give pleasure not consenting to do so. Let us be quite clear about it,” I went on, throwing a sop of sorts to her moral scruples, as I recalled how she and her friends had scarified the girl who went about with the actress Lea. “I don’t mean to say for a moment that a girl can behave exactly as she likes, or that there’s no such thing as immorality. Take, let me see now, yes, what you were saying the other day about a girl who is staying at Balbec and her relations with an actress; I call that degrading, so degrading that I feel sure it must all have been made up by the girl’s enemies, and that there can’t be any truth in the story. It strikes me as improbable, impossible. But to let a friend kiss you, and go farther than that even — since you say that I am your friend . . . ” “So you are, but I have had friends before now, I have known lots of young men who were every bit as friendly, I can assure you. There wasn’t one of them would ever have dared to do a thing like that. They knew they’d get their ears boxed if they tried it on. Besides, they never dreamed of trying, we would shake hands in an open, friendly sort of way, like good pals, but there was never a word said about kissing, and yet we weren’t any the less friends for that. Why, if it’s my friendship you are after, you’ve nothing to complain of; I must be jolly fond of you to forgive you. But I’m sure you don’t care two straws about me, really. Own up now, it’s Andrée you’re in love with. After all, you’re quite right; she is ever so much prettier than I am, and perfectly charming! Oh! You men!” Despite my recent disappointment, these words so frankly uttered, by giving me a great respect for Albertine, made a very pleasant impression on me. And perhaps this impression was to have serious and vexatious consequences for me later on, for it was round it that there began to form that feeling almost of brotherly intimacy, that moral core which was always to remain at the heart of my love for Albertine. A feeling of this sort may be the cause of the keenest pain. For in order really to suffer at the hands of a woman one must have believed in her completely. For the moment, that embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, was left embedded in me like a stepping-stone in a stream. It could have availed nothing, by itself, against my happiness if it had remained there without growing, in an inertia which it was to retain the following year, and still more during the final weeks of this first visit to Balbec. It dwelt in me like one of those foreign bodies which it would be wiser when all is said to expel, but which we leave where they are without disturbing them, so harmless for the present does their weakness, their isolation amid a strange environment render them

    My dreams were now once more at liberty to concentrate on one or another of Albertine’s friends, and returned first of all to Andrée, whose kindnesses might perhaps have appealed to me less strongly had I not been certain that they would come to Albertine’s ears. Undoubtedly the preference that I had long been pretending to feel for Andrée had furnished me — in the habit of conversation with her, of declaring my affection — with, so to speak, the material, prepared and ready, for a love of her which had hitherto lacked only the complement of a genuine sentiment, and this my heart being once more free was now in a position to supply. But for me really to love Andrée, she was too intellectual, too neurotic, too sickly, too much like myself. If Albertine now seemed to me to be void of substance, Andrée was filled with something which I knew only too well. I had thought, that first day, that what I saw on the beach there was the mistress of some racing cyclist, passionately athletic; and now Andrée told me that if she had taken up athletic pastimes, it was under orders from her doctor, to cure her neurasthenia, her digestive troubles, but that her happiest hours were those which she spent in translating one of George Eliot’s novels. The misunderstanding, due to an initial mistake as to what Andrée was, had not, as a matter of fact, the slightest importance. But my mistake was one of the kind which, if they allow love to be born, and are not recognised as mistakes until it has ceased to be under control, become a cause of suffering. Such mistakes — which may be quite different from mine with regard to Andrée, and even its exact opposite — are frequently due (and this was especially the case here) to our paying too much attention to the aspect, the manners of what a person is not but would like to be, in forming our first impression of that person. To the outward appearance affectation, imitation, the longing to be admired, whether by the good or by the wicked, add misleading similarities of speech and gesture. These are cynicisms and cruelties which, when put to the test, prove no more genuine than certain apparent virtues and generosities. Just as we often discover a vain miser beneath the cloak of a man famed for his bountiful charity, so her flaunting of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina a respectable girl with middle-class prejudices. I had thought to find in Andrée a healthy, primitive creature, whereas she was merely a person in search of health, as were doubtless many of those in whom she herself had thought to find it, and who were in reality no more healthy than a burly arthritic with a red face and in white flannels is necessarily a Hercules. Now there are circumstances in which it is not immaterial to our happiness that the person whom we have loved because of what appeared to be so healthy about her is in reality only one of those invalids who receive such health as they possess from others, as the planets borrow their light, as certain bodies are only conductors of electricity

    No matter, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, indeed more than they, was, when all was said, a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her conduct, so closely that, the first day, I had not at once distinguished them one from another. Over these girls, flowering sprays of roses whose principal charm was that they outlined themselves against the sea, the same undivided partnership prevailed as at the time when I did not know them, when the appearance of no matter which of them had caused me such violent emotion by its announcement that the little band was not far off. And even now the sight of one of them filled me with a pleasure into which there entered, to an extent which I should not have found it easy to define, the thought of seeing the others follow her in due course, and even if they did not come that day, speaking about them, and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach

    It was no longer simply the attraction of those first days, it was a regular love-longing which hesitated among them all, so far was each the natural substitute for the others. My bitterest grief would not have been to be thrown over by whichever of the girls I liked best, but I should at once have liked best, because I should have fastened on to her the whole of the melancholy dream which had been floating vaguely among them all, her who had thrown me over. It would, moreover, in that event, be the loss of all her friends, in whose eyes I should speedily have forfeited whatever advantage I might possess, that I should, in losing her, have unconsciously regretted, having vowed to them that sort of collective love which the politician and the actor feel for the public for whose desertion of them after they have enjoyed all its favours they can never be consoled. Even those favours which I had failed to win from Albertine I would hope suddenly to receive from one or other who had parted from me in the evening with a word or glance of ambiguous meaning, thanks to which it was to her that, for the next day or so, my desire would turn. It strayed among them all the more voluptuously in that upon those volatile faces a comparative fixation of features had now begun, and had been carried far enough for the eye to distinguish — even if it were to change yet further — each malleable and floating effigy. To the differences that existed among them there was doubtless very little that corresponded in the no less marked differences in the length and breadth of those features, any of which might, perhaps, dissimilar as the girls appeared, almost have been lifted bodily from one face and imposed at random upon any other. But our knowledge of faces is not mathematical. In the first place, it does not begin with the measurement of the parts, it takes as its starting point an expression, a combination of the whole. In Andrée, for instance, the fineness of her gentle eyes seemed to go with the thinness of her nose, as slender as a mere curve which one could imagine as having been traced in order to produce along a single line the idea of delicacy divided higher up between the dual smile of her twin gaze. A line equally fine was engraved in her hair, pliant and deep as the line with which the wind furrows the sand. And in her it must have been hereditary; for the snow-white hair of Andrée’s mother was driven in the same way, forming here a swelling, there a depression, like a snowdrift that rises or sinks according to the irregularities of the soil. Certainly, when compared with the fine delineation of Andrée’s, Rosemonde’s nose seemed to present broad surfaces, like a high tower raised upon massive foundations. Albeit expression suffices to make us believe in enormous differences between things that are separated by infinitely little — albeit that infinitely little may by itself create an expression that is absolutely unique, an individuality — it was not only the infinitely little of its lines and the originality of its expression that made each of these faces appear irreducible to terms of any other. Between my friends’ faces their colouring established a separation wider still, not so much by the varied beauty of the tones with which it provided them, so contrasted that I felt when I looked at Rosemonde — flooded with a sulphurous rose colour, with the further contrast of the greenish light in her eyes — and then at Andrée — whose white cheeks received such an austere distinction from her black hair — the same kind of pleasure as if I had been looking alternately at a geranium growing by a sunlit sea and a camellia in the night; but principally because the infinitely little differences of their lines were enlarged out of all proportion, the relations between one and another surface entirely changed by this new element of colour which, in addition to being a dispenser of tints, is great at restoring, or rather at altering, dimensions. So that faces which were perhaps constructed on not dissimilar lines, according as they were lighted by the flaming torch of an auburn poll or high complexion, or by the white glimmer of a dull pallor, grew sharper or broader, became something else, like those properties used in the Russian ballet, consisting sometimes, when they are seen in the light of day, of a mere disc of paper, out of which the genius of a Bakst, according to the blood-red or moonlit effect in which he plunges his stage, makes a hard incrustation, like a turquoise on a palace well, or a swooning softness, as of a Bengal rose in an eastern garden. And so when acquiring a knowledge of faces we take careful measurements, but as painters, not as surveyors

    So it was with Albertine as with her friends. On certain days, slim, with grey cheeks, a sullen air, a violet transparency falling obliquely from her such as we notice sometimes on the sea, she seemed to be feeling the sorrows of exile. On other days her face, more sleek, caught and glued my desires to its varnished surface and prevented them from going any farther; unless I caught a sudden glimpse of her from the side, for her dull cheeks, like white wax on the surface, were visibly pink beneath, which made me anxious to kiss them, to reach that different tint which thus avoided my touch. At other times happiness bathed her cheeks with a clarity so mobile that the skin, grown fluid and vague, gave passage to a sort of stealthy and subcutaneous gaze, which made it appear to be of another colour but not of another substance than her eyes; sometimes, instinctively, when one looked at her face punctuated with tiny brown marks among which floated what were simply two larger, bluer stains, it was like looking at the egg of a goldfinch — or often like an opalescent agate cut and polished in two places only, where, from the heart of the brown stone, shone like the transparent wings of a sky-blue butterfly her eyes, those features in which the flesh becomes a mirror and gives us the illusion that it allows us, more than through the other parts of the body, to approach the soul. But most often of all she shewed more colour, and was then more animated; sometimes the only pink thing in her white face was the tip of her nose, as finely pointed as that of a mischievous kitten with which one would have liked to stop and play; sometimes her cheeks were so glossy that one’s glance slipped, as over the surface of a miniature, over their pink enamel, which was made to appear still more delicate, more private, by the enclosing though half-opened case of her black hair; or it might happen that the tint of her cheeks had deepened to the violet shade of the red cyclamen, and, at times, even, when she was flushed or feverish, with a suggestion of un-healthiness which lowered my desire to something more sensual and made her glance expressive of something more perverse and unwholesome, to the deep purple of certain roses, a red that was almost black; and each of these Albertines was different, as in every fresh appearance of the dancer whose colours, form, character, are transmuted according to the innumerably varied play of a projected limelight. It was perhaps because they were so different, the persons whom I used to contemplate in her at this period, that later on I became myself a different person, corresponding to the particular Albertine to whom my thoughts had turned; a jealous, an indifferent, a voluptuous, a melancholy, a frenzied person, created anew not merely by the accident of what memory had risen to the surface, but in proportion also to the strength of the belief that was lent to the support of one and the same memory by the varying manner in which I appreciated it. For this is the point to which we must always return, to these beliefs with which most of the time we are quite unconsciously filled, but which for all that are of more importance to our happiness than is the average person whom we see, for it is through them that we see him, it is they that impart his momentary greatness to the person seen. To be quite accurate I ought to give a different name to each of the ‘me’s’ who were to think about Albertine in time to come; I ought still more to give a different name to each of the Albertines who appeared before me, never the same, like — called by me simply and for the sake of convenience ‘the sea’— those seas that succeeded one another on the beach, in front of which, a nymph likewise, she stood apart. But above all, in the same way as, in telling a story (though to far greater purpose here), one mentions what the weather was like on such and such a day, I ought always to give its name to the belief that, on any given day on which I saw Albertine, was reigning in my soul, creating its atmosphere, the appearance of people like that of seas being dependent on those clouds, themselves barely visible, which change the colour of everything by their concentration, their mobility, their dissemination, their flight — like that cloud which Elstir had rent one evening by not introducing me to these girls, with whom he had stopped to talk, whereupon their forms, as they moved away, had suddenly increased in beauty — a cloud that had formed again a few days later when I did get to know the girls, veiling their brightness, interposing itself frequently between my eyes and them, opaque and soft, like Virgil’s Leucothea

    No doubt, all their faces had assumed quite new meanings for me since the manner in which they were to be read had been to some extent indicated to me by their talk, talk to which I could ascribe a value all the greater in that, by questioning them, I could prompt it whenever I chose, could vary it like an experimenter who seeks by corroborative proofs to establish the truth of his theory. And it is, after all, as good a way as any of solving the problem of existence to approach near enough to the things that have appeared to us from a distance to be beautiful and mysterious, to be able to satisfy ourselves that they have neither mystery nor beauty. It is one of the systems of hygiene among which we are at liberty to choose our own, a system which is perhaps not to be recommended too strongly, but it gives us a certain tranquillity with which to spend what remains of life, and also — since it enables us to regref nothing, by assuring us that we have attained to the best, and that the best was nothing out of the common — with which to resign ourselves to death

    I had now substituted, in the brains of these girls, for their supposed contempt for chastity, their memories of daily ‘incidents,’ honest principles, liable, it might be, to relaxation, but principles which had hitherto kept unscathed the children who had acquired them in their own respectable homes. And yet, when one has been mistaken from the start, even in trifling details, when an error of assumption or recollection makes one seek for the author of a malicious slander, or for the place where one has lost something, in the wrong direction, it frequently happens that one discovers one’s error only to substitute for it not the truth but a fresh error. I drew, so far as their manner of life and the proper way to behave with them went, all the possible conclusions from the word ‘Innocence’ which I had read, in talking familiarly with them, upon their faces. But perhaps I had been reading carelessly, with the inaccuracy born of a too rapid deciphering, and it was no more written there than was the name of Jules Ferry on the programme of the performance at which I had heard Berma for the first time, an omission which had not prevented me from maintaining to M. de Norpois that Jules Ferry, beyond any possibility of doubt, was a person who wrote curtain-raisers

    No matter which it might be of my friends of the little band, was not inevitably the face that I had last seen the only face that I could recall, since, of our memories with respect to a person, the mind eliminates everything that does not agree with our immediate purpose of our daily relations (especially if those relations are quickened with an element of love which, ever unsatisfied, lives always in the moment that is about to come)? That purpose allows the chain of spent days to slip away, holding on only to the very end of it, often of a quite different metal from the links that have vanished in the night, and in the journey which we make through life, counts as real only in the place in which we at any given moment are. But all those earliest impressions, already so remote, could not find, against the blunting process that assailed them day after day, any remedy in my memory; during the long hours which I spent in talking, eating, playing with these girls, I did not remember even that they were the same ruthless, sensual virgins whom I had seen, as in a fresco, file past between me and the sea

    Geographers, archaeologists may conduct us over Calypso’s island, may excavate the Palace of Minos. Only Calypso becomes then nothing more than a woman, Minos than a king with no semblance of divinity. Even the good and bad qualities which history teaches us to have been the attributes of those quite real personages, often differ widely from those which we had ascribed to the fabulous beings who bore the same names as they. Thus had there faded and vanished all the lovely mythology of Ocean which I had composed in those first days. But it is not altogether immaterial that we do succeed, at any rate now and then, in spending our time in familiar intercourse with what we have thought to be unattainable and have longed to possess. In our later dealings with people whom at first we found disagreeable there persists always, even among the artificial pleasure which we have come at length to enjoy in their society, the lingering taint of the defects which they have succeeded in hiding. But, in relations such as I was now having with Albertine and her friends, the genuine pleasure which was there at the start leaves that fragrance which no amount of skill can impart to hot-house fruits, to grapes that have not ripened in the sun. The supernatural creatures which for a little time they had been to me still introduced, even without any intention on my part, a miraculous element into the most commonplace dealings that I might have with them, or rather prevented such dealings from ever becoming commonplace at all. My desire had sought so ardently to learn the significance of the eyes which now knew and smiled to see me, but whose glances on the first day had crossed mine like rays from another universe; it had distributed so generously, so carefully, so minutely, colour and fragrance over the carnation surfaces of these girls who now, outstretched on the cliff-top, were simply offering me sandwiches or guessing riddles, that often, in the afternoon, while I lay there among them, like those painters who seek to match the grandeurs of antiquity in modern life, give to a woman cutting her toe-nail the nobility of the Spinario, or, like Rubens, make goddesses out of women whom they know, to people some mythological scene; at those lovely forms, dark and fair, so dissimilar in type, scattered around me in the grass, I would gaze without emptying them, perhaps, of all the mediocre contents with which my everyday experience had filled them, and at the same time without expressly recalling their heavenly origin, as if, like young Hercules or young Telemachus, I had been set to play amid a band of nymphs

    Then the concerts ended, the bad weather began, my friends left Balbec; not all at once, like the swallows, but all in the same week. Albertine was the first to go, abruptly, without any of her friends understanding, then or afterwards, why she had returned suddenly to Paris whither neither her work nor any amusement summoned her. “She said neither why nor wherefore, and with that she left!” muttered Françoise, who, for that matter, would have liked us to leave as well. We were, she thought, inconsiderate towards the staff, now greatly reduced in number, but retained on account of the few visitors who were still staying on, and towards the manager who was ‘just eating up money.’ It was true that the hotel, which would very soon be closed for the winter, had long since seen most of its patrons depart, but never had it been so attractive. This view was not shared by the manager; from end to end of the rooms in which we sat shivering, and and at the doors of which no page now stood on guard, he paced the corridors, wearing a new frock coat, so well tended by the hairdresser that his insipid face appeared to be made of some composition in which, for one part of flesh, there were three of cosmetics, incessantly changing his neckties. (These refinements cost less than having the place heated and keeping on the staff, just as a man who is no longer able to subscribe ten thousand francs to a charity can still parade his generosity without inconvenience to himself by tipping the boy who brings him a telegram with five.) He appeared to be inspecting the empty air, to be seeking to give, by the smartness of his personal appearance, a provisional splendour to the desolation that could now be felt in this hotel where the season had not been good, and walked like the ghost of a monarch who returns to haunt the ruins of what was once his palace. He was particularly annoyed when the little local railway company, finding the supply of passengers inadequate, discontinued its trains until the following spring. “What is lacking here,” said the manager, “is the means of commotion.” In spite of the deficit which his books shewed, he was making plans for the future on a lavish scale. And as he was, after all, capable of retaining an exact memory of fine language when it was directly applicable to the hotel-keeping industry and had the effect of enhancing its importance: “I was not adequately supported, although in the dining room I had an efficient squad,” he explained; “but the pages left something to be desired. You will see, next year, what a phalanx I shall collect.” In the meantime the suspension of the services of the B. C. B. obliged him to send for letters and occasionally to dispatch visitors in a light cart. I would often ask leave to sit by the driver, and in this way I managed to be out in all weathers, as in the winter that I had spent at Combray

    Sometimes, however, the driving rain kept my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely deserted, as in the lowest hold of a ship when a storm is raging; and there, day by day, as in the course of a sea-voyage, a new person from among those in whose company we had spent three months without getting to know them, the chief magistrate from Caen, the leader of the Cherbourg bar, an American lady and her daughters, came up to us, started conversation, discovered some way of making the time pass less slowly, revealed some social accomplishment, taught us a new game, invited us to drink tea or to listen to music, to meet them at a certain hour, to plan together some of those diversions which contain the true secret of pleasure-giving, which is to aim not at giving pleasure but simply at helping us to pass the time of our boredom, in a word, formed with us, at the end of our stay at Balbec, ties of friendship which, in a day or two, their successive departures from the place would sever. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his pair of aristocratic friends and of the actress, who had reappeared for a few days; but their little society was composed now of three persons only, the other friend having returned to Paris. They asked me to come out to dinner with them at their restaurant. I think, they were just as well pleased that I did not accept. But they had given the invitation in the most friendly way imaginable, and albeit it came actually from the rich young man, since the others were only his guests, as the friend who was staying with him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaudémont, came of a very good family indeed, instinctively the actress, in asking me whether I would not come, said, to flatter my vanity: “Maurice will be so pleased.”

    And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaudémont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: “Won’t you give us the pleasure of dining with us?”

    On the whole I had derived very little benefit from Balbec, but this only strengthened my desire to return there. It seemed to me that I had not stayed there long enough. This was not what my friends at home were thinking, who wrote to ask whether I meant to stay there for the rest of my life. And when I saw that it was the name ‘Balbec’ which they were obliged to put on the envelope — just as my window looked out not over a landscape or a street but on to the plains of the sea, as I heard through the night its murmur to which I had before going to sleep entrusted my ship of dreams, I had the illusion that this life of promiscuity with the waves must effectively, without my knowledge, pervade me with the notion of their charm, like those lessons which one leams by heart while one is asleep

    The manager offered to reserve better rooms for me next year, but I had now become attached to mine, into which I went without ever noticing the scent of flowering grasses, while my mind, which had once found such difficulty in rising to fill its space had come now to take its measurements so exactly that I was obliged to submit it to a reverse process when I had to sleep in Paris, in my own room, the ceiling of which was low

    It was high time, indeed, to leave Balbec, for the cold and damp had become too penetrating for us to stay any longer in a hotel which had neither fireplaces in the rooms nor a central furnace. Moreover, I forgot almost immediately these last weeks of our stay. What my mind’s eye did almost invariably see when I thought of Balbec were the hours which, every morning during the fine weather, as I was going out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother, following the doctor’s orders, insisted on my spending lying down, with the room darkened. The manager gave instructions that no noise was to be made on my landing, and came up himself to see that they were obeyed. Because the light outside was so strong, I kept drawn for as long as possible the big violet curtains which had adopted so hostile an attitude towards me the first evening. But as, in spite of the pins with which, so that the light should not enter, Françoise fastened them every night, pins which she alone knew how to unfasten; as in spite of the rugs, the red cretonne table-cover, the various fabrics collected here and there which she fitted in to her defensive scheme, she never succeeded in making them meet exactly, the darkness was not complete, and they allowed to spill over the carpet as it were a scarlet shower of anemone-petals, among which I could not resist the temptation to plunge my bare feet for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window and so was partially lighted, a cylinder of gold with no visible support was placed vertically and moved slowly along like the pillar of fire which went before the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste without moving, in imagination only, and all at once, the pleasures of games, bathing, walks which the morning prompted, joy made my heart beat thunderingly like a machine set going at full speed but fixed to the ground, which can spend its energy only by turning upon its own axis

    I knew that my friends were on the ‘front,’ but I did not see them as they passed before the links of the sea’s uneven chain, far at the back of which, and nestling amid its bluish peaks like an Italian citadel, one could occasionally, in a clear moment, make out the little town of Rivebelle, drawn in minutest detail by the sun. I did not see my friends, but (while there mounted to my belvedere the shout of the newsboy, the ‘journalists’ as Françoise used to call them, the shouts of the bathers and of children at play, punctuating like the cries of sea-birds the sound of the gently breaking waves) I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like the laughter of the Nereids in the smooth tide of sound that rose to my ears. “We looked up,” said Albertine in the evening, “to see if you were coming down. But your shutters were still closed when the concert began.” At ten o’clock, sure enough, it broke out beneath my windows. In the intervals in the blare of the instruments, if the tide were high, would begin again, slurred and continuous, the gliding surge of a wave which seemed to enfold the notes of the violin in its crystal spirals and to be spraying its foam over echoes of a submarine music. I grew impatient because no one had yet come with my things, so that I might rise and dress. Twelve o’clock struck, Françoise arrived at last. And for months on end, in this Balbec to which I had so looked forward because I imagined it only as battered by the storm and buried in fogs, the weather had been so dazzling and so unchanging that when she came to open the window I could always, without once being wrong, expect to see the same patch of sunlight folded in the corner of the outer wall, of an unalterable colour which was less moving as a sign of summer than depressing as the colour of a lifeless and composed enamel. And after Françoise had removed her pins from the mouldings of the window-frame, taken down her various cloths, and drawn back the curtains, the summer day which she disclosed seemed as dead, as immemorially ancient as would have been a sumptuously attired dynastic mummy from which our old servant had done no more than pre-cautionally unwind the linen wrappings before displaying it to my gaze, embalmed in its vesture of goldEmbed"

Windows down, heater on

Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

[Chorus 2]
""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""

""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.

THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)

I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.

(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.

STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)

PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A DEADHAND (Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"

471,Blue Eyes,Blue Eyes,Reyn Hartley,Sad,"I.
Oh, thou, in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,
Muse, formed or fabled at the minstrel's will!
Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,
Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill:
Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;
Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long-deserted shrine
Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;
Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
To grace so plain a tale—this lowly lay of mine.

II.
Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,
Who ne in virtue's ways did take delight;
But spent his days in riot most uncouth,
And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
Ah, me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,
Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
Few earthly things found favour in his sight
Save concubines and carnal companie,
And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.

III.
Childe Harold was he hight:—but whence his name
And lineage long, it suits me not to say;
Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,
And had been glorious in another day:
But one sad losel soils a name for aye,
However mighty in the olden time;
Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,
Nor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,
Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.
IV.
Childe Harold basked him in the noontide sun,
Disporting there like any other fly,
Nor deemed before his little day was done
One blast might chill him into misery.
But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,
Worse than adversity the Childe befell;
He felt the fulness of satiety:
Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,
Which seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.

V.
For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,
Nor made atonement when he did amiss,
Had sighed to many, though he loved but one,
And that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his.
Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss
Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,
And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,
Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.

VI.
And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,
And from his fellow bacchanals would flee;
'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,
But pride congealed the drop within his e'e:
Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,
And from his native land resolved to go,
And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.
VII.
The Childe departed from his father's hall;
It was a vast and venerable pile;
So old, it seemed only not to fall,
Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!
Where superstition once had made her den,
Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;
And monks might deem their time was come agen,
If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.

VIII.
Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,
Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,
As if the memory of some deadly feud
Or disappointed passion lurked below:
But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
For his was not that open, artless soul
That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;
Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.

IX.
And none did love him: though to hall and bower
He gathered revellers from far and near,
He knew them flatterers of the festal hour;
The heartless parasites of present cheer.
Yea, none did love him—not his lemans dear—
But pomp and power alone are woman's care,
And where these are light Eros finds a feere;
Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.
X.
Childe Harold had a mother—not forgot,
Though parting from that mother he did shun;
A sister whom he loved, but saw her not
Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.
Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;
Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon
A few dear objects, will in sadness feel
Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.

XI.
His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,
The laughing dames in whom he did delight,
Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
Might shake the saintship of an anchorite,
And long had fed his youthful appetite;
His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,
And all that mote to luxury invite,
Without a sigh he left to cross the brine,
And traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.

XII.
The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew
As glad to waft him from his native home;
And fast the white rocks faded from his view,
And soon were lost in circumambient foam;
And then, it may be, of his wish to roam
Repented he, but in his bosom slept
The silent thought, nor from his lips did come
One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,
And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.

XIII.
But when the sun was sinking in the sea,
He seized his harp, which he at times could string,
And strike, albeit with untaught melody,
When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,
And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,
While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
And fleeting shores receded from his sight,
Thus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.'

1.
Adieu, adieu! my native shore
Fades o'er the waters blue;
The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
Yon sun that sets upon the sea
We follow in his flight;
Farewell awhile to him and thee,
My Native Land—Good Night!

2.
A few short hours, and he will rise
To give the morrow birth;
And I shall hail the main and skies,
But not my mother earth.
Deserted is my own good hall,
Its hearth is desolate;
Wild weeds are gathering on the wall,
My dog howls at the gate.

3.
'Come hither, hither, my little page:
Why dost thou weep and wail?
Or dost thou dread the billow's rage,
Or tremble at the gale?
But dash the tear-drop from thine eye,
Our ship is swift and strong;
Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
More merrily along.'

4.
'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
I fear not wave nor wind;
Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
Am sorrowful in mind;
For I have from my father gone,
A mother whom I love,
And have no friend, save these alone,
But thee—and One above.

5.
'My father blessed me fervently,
Yet did not much complain;
But sorely will my mother sigh
Till I come back again.'—
'Enough, enough, my little lad!
Such tears become thine eye;
If I thy guileless bosom had,
Mine own would not be dry.

6.
'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
Why dost thou look so pale?
Or dost thou dread a French foeman,
Or shiver at the gale?'—
'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
But thinking on an absent wife
Will blanch a faithful cheek.

7.
'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
Along the bordering lake;
And when they on their father call,
What answer shall she make?'—
'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
Thy grief let none gainsay;
But I, who am of lighter mood,
Will laugh to flee away.'

8.
For who would trust the seeming sighs
Of wife or paramour?
Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
We late saw streaming o'er.
For pleasures past I do not grieve,
Nor perils gathering near;
My greatest grief is that I leave
No thing that claims a tear.

9.
And now I'm in the world alone,
Upon the wide, wide sea;
But why should I for others groan,
When none will sigh for me?
Perchance my dog will whine in vain
Till fed by stranger hands;
But long ere I come back again
He'd tear me where he stands.

10.
With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
Athwart the foaming brine;
Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
So not again to mine.
Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!
And when you fail my sight,
Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
My Native Land—Good Night!

XIV.
On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
New shores descried make every bosom gay;
And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,
And Tagus dashing onward to the deep,
His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.

XV.
Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
But man would mar them with an impious hand:
And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge.

XVI.
What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
Her image floating on that noble tide,
Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,
But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
And to the Lusians did her aid afford
A nation swoll'n with ignorance and pride,
Who lick, yet loathe, the hand that waves the sword.
To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.

XVII.
But whoso entereth within this town,
That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
Disconsolate will wander up and down,
Mid many things unsightly to strange e'e;
For hut and palace show like filthily;
The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
No personage of high or mean degree
Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.

XVIII.
Poor, paltry slaves! yet born midst noblest scenes—
Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
In variegated maze of mount and glen.
Ah me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
To follow half on which the eye dilates
Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
Than those whereof such things the bard relates,
Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates?

XIX.
The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,
The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
The mountain moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
The tender azure of the unruffled deep,
The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,
The vine on high, the willow branch below,
Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.

XX.
Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
And frequent turn to linger as you go,
From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
And rest ye at 'Our Lady's House of Woe;'
Where frugal monks their little relics show,
And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
Here impious men have punished been; and lo,
Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.

XXI.

And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path;
Yet deem not these devotion's offering—
These are memorials frail of murderous wrath;
For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
Poured forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
Throughout this purple land, where law secures not life!

XXII.

On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,
Are domes where whilom kings did make repair;
But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
Yet ruined splendour still is lingering there.
And yonder towers the prince's palace fair:
There thou, too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,
Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,
Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.

XXIII.

Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan.
Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow;
But now, as if a thing unblest by man,
Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!
Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
To halls deserted, portals gaping wide;
Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide.

XXIV.

Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
With diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,
A little fiend that scoffs incessantly,
There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
Whereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul.

XXV.

Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
And Policy regained what Arms had lost:
For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.

XXVI.

And ever since that martial synod met,
Britannia sickens, Cintra, at thy name;
And folks in office at the mention fret,
And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
How will posterity the deed proclaim!
Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
To view these champions cheated of their fame,
By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?

XXVII.

So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
Did take his way in solitary guise:
Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
More restless than the swallow in the skies:
Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
For Meditation fixed at times on him,
And conscious Reason whispered to despise
His early youth misspent in maddest whim;
But as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.

XXVIII.

To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits
A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:
Again he rouses from his moping fits,
But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.
Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
And o'er him many changing scenes must roll,
Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,
Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.

XXIX.

Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,
Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;
And church and court did mingle their array,
And mass and revel were alternate seen;
Lordlings and freres—ill-sorted fry, I ween!
But here the Babylonian whore had built
A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to garnish guilt.

XXX.

O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
(Oh that such hills upheld a free-born race!)
Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.
Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace.
Oh, there is sweetness in the mountain air
And life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.

XXXI.

More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
Spain's realms appear, whereon her shepherds tend
Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows—
Now must the pastor's arm his lambs defend:
For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.

XXXII.

Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
Or e'er the jealous queens of nations greet,
Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
Or dark sierras rise in craggy pride?
Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?—
Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall
Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul

XXXIII.

But these between a silver streamlet glides,
And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides.
Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow:
For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.

XXXIV.

But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
So noted ancient roundelays among.
Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest;
Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.

XXXV.

Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic land!
Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,
When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
That dyed thy mountain-streams with Gothic gore?
Where are those bloody banners which of yore
Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?
Red gleamed the cross, and waned the crescent pale,
While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.

XXXVI.

Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
Ah! such, alas, the hero's amplest fate!
When granite moulders and when records fail,
A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
Pride! bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate,
See how the mighty shrink into a song!
Can volume, pillar, pile, preserve thee great?
Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?

XXXVII.

Awake, ye sons of Spain! awake! advance
Lo! Chivalry, your ancient goddess, cries,
But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar!
In every peal she calls—'Awake! arise!'
Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?

XXXVIII.

Hark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;
Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
Tyrants and tyrants' slaves?—the fires of death,
The bale-fires flash on high:—from rock to rock
Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe:
Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
Red Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.

XXXIX.

Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
His blood-red tresses deepening in the sun,
With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
Flashing afar,—and at his iron feet
Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
For on this morn three potent nations meet,
To shed before his shrine the blood he deems most sweet.

XL.

By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see
(For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,
Their various arms that glitter in the air!
What gallant war-hounds rouse them from their lair,
And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
All join the chase, but few the triumph share:
The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
And Havoc scarce for joy can cumber their array.

XLI.

Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies.
The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
The foe, the victim, and the fond ally
That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,
Are met—as if at home they could not die—
To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.

XLII.

There shall they rot—Ambition's honoured fools!
Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!
Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,
The broken tools, that tyrants cast away
By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
With human hearts—to what?—a dream alone.
Can despots compass aught that hails their sway?
Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?

XLIII.

O Albuera, glorious field of grief!
As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed.
Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed
And tears of triumph their reward prolong!
Till others fall where other chieftains lead,
Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.

XLIV.

Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
In sooth, 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,
And die, that living might have proved her shame;
Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.

XLV.

Full swiftly Harold wends his lonely way
Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:
Yet is she free—the spoiler's wished-for prey!
Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
Inevitable hour!  'Gainst fate to strive
Where Desolation plants her famished brood
Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre, might yet survive,
And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive.

XLVI.

But all unconscious of the coming doom,
The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds;
Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;
Here Folly still his votaries enthralls,
And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:
Girt with the silent crimes of capitals,
Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tottering walls.

XLVII.

Not so the rustic:  with his trembling mate
He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
Blasted below the dun hot breath of war.
No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:
Ah, monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;
The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet.

XLVIII.

How carols now the lusty muleteer?
Of love, romance, devotion is his lay,
As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
No! as he speeds, he chants 'Viva el Rey!'
And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.

XLIX.

On yon long level plain, at distance crowned
With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
Wide scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
Here the brave peasant stormed the dragon's nest;
Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.

L.

And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:
Woe to the man that walks in public view
Without of loyalty this token true:
Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
And sorely would the Gallic foemen rue,
If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloak,
Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.

LI.

At every turn Morena's dusky height
Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,
The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
The holstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,

LII.

Portend the deeds to come:—but he whose nod
Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
A little moment deigneth to delay:
Soon will his legions sweep through these the way;
The West must own the Scourger of the world.
Ah, Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning day,
When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,
And thou shalt view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.

LIII.

And must they fall—the young, the proud, the brave—
To swell one bloated chief's unwholesome reign?
No step between submission and a grave?
The rise of rapine and the fall of Spain?
And doth the Power that man adores ordain
Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal,
The veteran's skill, youth's fire, and manhood's heart of steel?

LIV.

Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
And, all unsexed, the anlace hath espoused,
Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
Appalled, an owlet's larum chilled with dread,
Now views the column-scattering bayonet jar,
The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.

LV.

Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
Heard her light, lively tones in lady's bower,
Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.

LVI.

Her lover sinks—she sheds no ill-timed tear;
Her chief is slain—she fills his fatal post;
Her fellows flee—she checks their base career;
The foe retires—she heads the sallying host:
Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?

LVII.

Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
But formed for all the witching arts of love:
Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
In softness as in firmness far above
Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.

LVIII.

The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:
Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
Her glance, how wildly beautiful! how much
Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek
Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
How poor their forms appear? how languid, wan, and weak!

LIX.

Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
Match me, ye harems! of the land where now
I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
Beauties that even a cynic must avow!
Match me those houris, whom ye scarce allow
To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
With Spain's dark-glancing daughters—deign to know,
There your wise Prophet's paradise we find,
His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.

LX.

O thou, Parnassus! whom I now survey,
Not in the frenzy of a dreamer's eye,
Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,
But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
In the wild pomp of mountain majesty!
What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
Would gladly woo thine echoes with his string,
Though from thy heights no more one muse will wave her wing.

LXI.

Oft have I dreamed of thee! whose glorious name
Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
And now I view thee, 'tis, alas, with shame
That I in feeblest accents must adore.
When I recount thy worshippers of yore
I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
In silent joy to think at last I look on thee!

LXII.

Happier in this than mightiest bards have been,
Whose fate to distant homes confined their lot,
Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
Which others rave of, though they know it not?
Though here no more Apollo haunts his grot,
And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
Some gentle spirit still pervades the spot,
Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,
And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.

LXIII.

Of thee hereafter.—Even amidst my strain
I turned aside to pay my homage here;
Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
Her fate, to every free-born bosom dear;
And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
Now to my theme—but from thy holy haunt
Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.

LXIV.

But ne'er didst thou, fair mount, when Greece was young,
See round thy giant base a brighter choir;
Nor e'er did Delphi, when her priestess sung
The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
Behold a train more fitting to inspire
The song of love than Andalusia's maids,
Nurst in the glowing lap of soft desire:
Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.

LXV.

Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days,
But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,
Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
The fascination of thy magic gaze?
A cherub-hydra round us dost thou gape,
And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.

LXVI.

When Paphos fell by Time—accursed Time!
The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee—
The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
And Venus, constant to her native sea,
To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
And fixed her shrine within these walls of white;
Though not to one dome circumscribeth she
Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
A thousand altars rise, for ever blazing bright.

LXVII.

From morn till night, from night till startled morn
Peeps blushing on the revel's laughing crew,
The song is heard, the rosy garland worn;
Devices quaint, and frolics ever new,
Tread on each other's kibes.  A long adieu
He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu
Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
And love and prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.

LXVIII.

The sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest;
What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
Lo! it is sacred to a solemn feast:
Hark! heard you not the forest monarch's roar?
Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn:
The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
Nor shrinks the female eye, nor e'en affects to mourn.

LXIX.

The seventh day this; the jubilee of man.
London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
Then thy spruce citizen, washed artizan,
And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
Thy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,
And humblest gig, through sundry suburbs whirl;
To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow, make repair;
Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.

LXX.

Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,
Others along the safer turnpike fly;
Some Richmond Hill ascend, some scud to Ware,
And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
Ask ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why?
'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.

LXXI.

All have their fooleries; not alike are thine,
Fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!
Soon as the matin bell proclaimeth nine,
Thy saint adorers count the rosary:
Much is the Virgin teased to shrive them free
(Well do I ween the only virgin there)
From crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;
Then to the crowded circus forth they fare:
Young, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.

LXXII.

The lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,
Thousands on thousands piled are seated round;
Long ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,
No vacant space for lated wight is found:
Here dons, grandees, but chiefly dames abound,
Skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,
Yet ever well inclined to heal the wound;
None through their cold disdain are doomed to die,
As moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.

LXXIII.

Hushed is the din of tongues—on gallant steeds,
With milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,
Four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,
And lowly bending to the lists advance;
Rich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:
If in the dangerous game they shine to-day,
The crowd's loud shout, and ladies' lovely glance,
Best prize of better acts, they bear away,
And all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.

LXXIV.

In costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed,
But all afoot, the light-limbed matadore
Stands in the centre, eager to invade
The lord of lowing herds; but not before
The ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,
Lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:
His arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more
Can man achieve without the friendly steed—
Alas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.

LXXV.

Thrice sounds the clarion; lo! the signal falls,
The den expands, and expectation mute
Gapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.
Bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,
And wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,
The sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:
Here, there, he points his threatening front, to suit
His first attack, wide waving to and fro
His angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.

LXXVI.

Sudden he stops; his eye is fixed:  away,
Away, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear;
Now is thy time to perish, or display
The skill that yet may check his mad career.
With well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;
On foams the bull, but not unscathed he goes;
Streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:
He flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes:
Dart follows dart; lance, lance; loud bellowings speak his woes.

LXXVII.

Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,
Nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;
Though man and man's avenging arms assail,
Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force.
One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;
Another, hideous sight! unseamed appears,
His gory chest unveils life's panting source;
Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;
Staggering, but stemming all, his lord unharmed he bears.

LXXVIII.

Foiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,
Full in the centre stands the bull at bay,
Mid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,
And foes disabled in the brutal fray:
And now the matadores around him play,
Shake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:
Once more through all he bursts his thundering way—
Vain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,
Wraps his fierce eye—'tis past—he sinks upon the sand.

LXXIX.

Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
He stops—he starts—disdaining to decline:
Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
The decorated car appears on high:
The corse is piled—sweet sight for vulgar eyes;
Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
Hurl the dark bull along, scarce seen in dashing by.

LXXX.

Such the ungentle sport that oft invites
The Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain:
Nurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights
In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.
What private feuds the troubled village stain!
Though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,
Enough, alas, in humble homes remain,
To meditate 'gainst friends the secret blow,
For some slight cause of wrath, whence life's warm stream must flow.

LXXXI.

But Jealousy has fled:  his bars, his bolts,
His withered sentinel, duenna sage!
And all whereat the generous soul revolts,
Which the stern dotard deemed he could encage,
Have passed to darkness with the vanished age.
Who late so free as Spanish girls were seen
(Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage),
With braided tresses bounding o'er the green,
While on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?

LXXXII.

Oh! many a time and oft had Harold loved,
Or dreamed he loved, since rapture is a dream;
But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream:
And lately had he learned with truth to deem
Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs
Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.

LXXXIII.

Yet to the beauteous form he was not blind,
Though now it moved him as it moves the wise;
Not that Philosophy on such a mind
E'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:
But Passion raves itself to rest, or flies;
And Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,
Had buried long his hopes, no more to rise:
Pleasure's palled victim! life-abhorring gloom
Wrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.

LXXXIV.

Still he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;
But viewed them not with misanthropic hate;
Fain would he now have joined the dance, the song,
But who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?
Nought that he saw his sadness could abate:
Yet once he struggled 'gainst the demon's sway,
And as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,
Poured forth this unpremeditated lay,
To charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.

TO INEZ.

Nay, smile not at my sullen brow,
Alas! I cannot smile again:
Yet Heaven avert that ever thou
Shouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.

And dost thou ask what secret woe
I bear, corroding joy and youth?
And wilt thou vainly seek to know
A pang even thou must fail to soothe?

It is not love, it is not hate,
Nor low Ambition's honours lost,
That bids me loathe my present state,
And fly from all I prized the most:

It is that weariness which springs
From all I meet, or hear, or see:
To me no pleasure Beauty brings;
Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.

It is that settled, ceaseless gloom
The fabled Hebrew wanderer bore,
That will not look beyond the tomb,
But cannot hope for rest before.

What exile from himself can flee?
To zones, though more and more remote,
Still, still pursues, where'er I be,
The blight of life—the demon Thought.

Yet others rapt in pleasure seem,
And taste of all that I forsake:
Oh! may they still of transport dream,
And ne'er, at least like me, awake!

Through many a clime 'tis mine to go,
With many a retrospection curst;
And all my solace is to know,
Whate'er betides, I've known the worst.

What is that worst?  Nay, do not ask—
In pity from the search forbear:
Smile on—nor venture to unmask
Man's heart, and view the hell that's there.

LXXXV.

Adieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!
Who may forget how well thy walls have stood?
When all were changing, thou alone wert true,
First to be free, and last to be subdued.
And if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,
Some native blood was seen thy streets to dye,
A traitor only fell beneath the feud:
Here all were noble, save nobility;
None hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen Chivalry!

LXXXVI.

Such be the sons of Spain, and strange her fate!
They fight for freedom, who were never free;
A kingless people for a nerveless state,
Her vassals combat when their chieftains flee,
True to the veriest slaves of Treachery;
Fond of a land which gave them nought but life,
Pride points the path that leads to liberty;
Back to the struggle, baffled in the strife,
War, war is still the cry, 'War even to the knife!'

LXXXVII.

Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,
Go, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:
Whate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe
Can act, is acting there against man's life:
From flashing scimitar to secret knife,
War mouldeth there each weapon to his need—
So may he guard the sister and the wife,
So may he make each curst oppressor bleed,
So may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!

LXXXVIII.

Flows there a tear of pity for the dead?
Look o'er the ravage of the reeking plain:
Look on the hands with female slaughter red;
Then to the dogs resign the unburied slain,
Then to the vulture let each corse remain;
Albeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw,
Let their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,
Long mark the battle-field with hideous awe:
Thus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!

LXXXIX.

Nor yet, alas, the dreadful work is done;
Fresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:
It deepens still, the work is scarce begun,
Nor mortal eye the distant end foresees.
Fall'n nations gaze on Spain:  if freed, she frees
More than her fell Pizarros once enchained.
Strange retribution! now Columbia's ease
Repairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,
While o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.

XC.

Not all the blood at Talavera shed,
Not all the marvels of Barossa's fight,
Not Albuera lavish of the dead,
Have won for Spain her well-asserted right.
When shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?
When shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?
How many a doubtful day shall sink in night,
Ere the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,
And Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil?

XCI.

And thou, my friend! since unavailing woe
Bursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain—
Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
Pride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:
But thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,
By all forgotten, save the lonely breast,
And mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,
While glory crowns so many a meaner crest!
What hadst thou done, to sink so peacefully to rest?

XCII.

Oh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most!
Dear to a heart where nought was left so dear!
Though to my hopeless days for ever lost,
In dreams deny me not to see thee here!
And Morn in secret shall renew the tear
Of Consciousness awaking to her woes,
And Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,
Till my frail frame return to whence it rose,
And mourned and mourner lie united in repose.

XCIII.

Here is one fytte of Harold's pilgrimage.
Ye who of him may further seek to know,
Shall find some tidings in a future page,
If he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.
Is this too much?  Stern critic, say not so:
Patience! and ye shall hear what he beheld
In other lands, where he was doomed to go:
Lands that contain the monuments of eld,
Ere Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.Embed"

I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All-white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, oh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

490,January,January,Earthquake Lights,Sad,"Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U
Who did not feel the need to be elected

They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected

Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet rule as democracy dies

The lady's got potential, she was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella

OK, she couldn't act but she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella to be stellar

Yeah, just one shell and governments lose their nerve, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve

Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Peron, would-be dictator

He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later

Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
They haven't a chance, bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane

Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy was having a ball
The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron

He organized a concert with incredible flair
In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor

It was January twenty-second, 1944
A night to remember, yeah, that's for sure
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva
For that's the night that Peron first met EvaEmbed"

I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice

Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

Got your shawty on my pistol, made her empty out the clip

I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce
And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish

Only time a nigga hit my phone is when there's drama
Niggas feel a type of way 'cause I do what I wanna
While you was scared of sharks, I was posted with piranhas
I heard that you freaky, maybe you should teach me
I'm afraid to tell you how these other bitches treat me
Don't gotta worry, I'ma pull up when you need me
How my bitch bad is what I wonder like I'm Stevie

Wassup
Aye, wassup

[Verse 1: Le1f]

I’m chilling in the cut with my brother
Cool smooth like cocoa butter. (oh god)
Boss feng shui, other other
I’m gone. Leave the homeys alone
I ain’t gon’ answer my phone. (nah)
Nuh uh, because I’m up in zones and interstates
Rarely piping, usually papes, usually a blunt
Don’t front, don’t waste
Trap up the smoke up -no escape. Blow it in my face
Imma catch that case. Shit is safe. It’s never laced
Paranoia never phases, just the moon and the tide and the waves
Hakuna matata, no chromo. I’m crazy like K-Ci and Jojo
No rasta, but ganja I will blow
And I fuck with niggas who still grow (still grow)
I don’t want it with them roaches and rats. (nah)
I’m coming for them like Jeter at bat, for real
No piff, just killa kush and afghani. (whoa)
Got that Boody blowing circles all around me. (whoa)
Please, no jack herer in that philly. (wow)
No sativa, no maui waui, nigga. (wow wow)
Take a drift in the Audi, yo
It’s cool cuz my kush pack loudly. (yuh)
I’m sorry i’m not sorry i’m gonna hotbox it til it’s cloudy
Watch
You might also like[Chorus: Le1f]

Tha whip moves slow, so you know
Roll the windows down real slow
(Ohh!) It just hit me....
We doin’ 100 in the 65
Wildin. The homey stunt driving
Red and white lights passing by in my eyes, man
We lucky to be the livest
Floating in the sky while we flying in the ride

[Verse 2: Haleek Maul]

I swear, I drink too much, to think too much
To drink some more, then sip some more
Puff it off just forget the whore
Forget the law, windows up
Now hit that joint, then get to work
They want ya boy start slipping up
Stead I blister cunts and I kill 'em all
Eagle eye, never miss the mark
When the whip move slow better start to squawk
Duck nigga 'fore it get dark nigga
Haze turn your park to a fucking marsh nigga
Don't want nobody heart I'm just tryna mosh bitches
Too many problems, why you tryna solve 'em
Sweet like sugar I'm just trying to dissolve you
Demons at my bedside tryna whistle
When my head is in a place that feel too mellow
They never want to let go, they never let you settle
So I pack that dish and rip shit on some velcro
Give a fuck, hell no
Spit lava boy, hellhole
Do this till they off me and my casket close
'Cause I know they're praying for my casket closed
But fuck 'em all my hearse sitting on 24s
So hit that herb, let it ride
I'm the prince of darkness let me turn your day to night
Shit, bounce

Tha whip moves slow, so you know
Roll the windows down real slow
(Ohh!) It just hit me....

Red and white lights passing by in my eyes, man
We lucky to be the livest

502,They Don't Know About Us,Take Me Home (Expanded Edition),One Direction,Sad,"People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, ""They don't know
What they talk, talk, talkin' about"" (Talk, talk, talkin' about)
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh

[Chorus: Zayn, All, Liam]
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I love you's
But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (They don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

Keeps getting better all the time, girl

504,Not Yours,Not Yours,Allocai,Sad,"I'm hurting
I can feel my money draining
They take everything I make
And you wonder why I'm complaining
I break my neck to make this money
That they just come and take it from me
My wages ain't that great in the first place
I should be paying you nothing
But they keep on coming
And they keep on taking
These mothefuckers go ham on me every time I bring home the bacon
And I wonder what it's for
Ukraine, great funding a war
Have we spent enough yet
Shit, I guess not look here they come for some more

[Verse 2]
Fuck me I'm sore
Sucks being poor
You had the same job for the last six years
Wasn't struggling before
Back when Trump was in office
Fuck all the junk that they called him
I never saw any of the shit that people always said he was in the comments
All of it was nonsense
I ain't even trying to right him either
I'm just saying you gotta admit this shit was fine when he was the leader
It was fine when he was in charge
I never saw bills as high as they are
I never got chills just literally thinking about
Filling up my car
It shouldn't be that way
You might also like[Verse 3]
I don't care about Russia or Ukraine
But I do care about my own country
Is that insane?
I care a lot about all the tons of money that we're paying
Because it's mine, not yours and I'm the one that feels the pain
I get taxed out my fucking ass for every dime I make
It'd be fine if they would spend my money wisely
But no way
It'd be great if they would take it
And pay for important shit that
Benefited you and me and not just wag wars with it
And where the fuck are all the Liberals
I thought you stood against this shit
I thought the war machine was your enemy, now you're friends with it
Now you wanna go to war
Now you wanna fight
Now you wanna pick sides in a feud where everyone is white
Now you wanna get involved and go and blow a person up
I'm just saying, I'm surprised this altercation ain't diverse enough
No one deserves this stuff
I just don't believe the tears you weep
Countries with brown people get bombed every day
I don't hear a peep
You fucking Hypocrites
Thought the race thing was your schtick
I thought as long as white people were involved you don't give a shit
Those are your words, not mine
I'm just wondering why
Why do we have endless money for them
And none for Hawaii
[Verse 4]
Why is it every time Zielinski needs a loan from someone
We're the only ones that give it to him
Like we owe him something
We got issues of our own here at home that no one's discussing
And they keep growing
Cause no one in power is gonna do nothing
We're stuck
How the fuck we gonna help somebody else
When we can't even reach inside our own pockets to help ourselves
We could allocate that money to our own people in different ways
To clothe and feed and bathe
And let them know it'll be okay
We could definitely do that
Don't tell me it's not that simple
People overcomplicate this and make it some fucking riddle
Like ""You can't just feed everyone, are you insane?
You know how much that costs?""
Way less than we've sent to Ukraine
I know that for sure
You don't have to be a mathematician
Or a foreign relations expert to figure out that division
You don't have to draw a graph to see
It would cost a fraction to solve half of the problems we have
And stop them from happening
I'm just saying
What kind of fucking world we living in
So many billions we've given them
When's Europe chipping in
When we gonna start splitting and stirring up the dividends
And begin telling other nations it's your turn to lend a hand
[Verse 5]
Listen I don't think Ukraine deserves any of this
But I also don't think Zelinsky is as great as they said he is
I don't believe the media when they blurt shit on their shows
You'd have to be naive to think this dude's as pure as driven snow
No one is
Especially when you run a nation dog
Your morals are compromised the minute that you take the job
So I don't trust Zielinski, Putin, Biden or anyone
I don't think any of them give a fuck about all us little ones
All the people of Russia
All the people of Ukraine
Most the people of the USA probably feel the same
We don't want this shit
It's only the elites that do
They line their pockets
They profit from this
But not for me and you
Quite the contrary
In fact, we pay for it with our lives and money
They take chunks of everything we make and soldiers die for nothing
So they can gain some more power and keep their banks fat
And all we get is table scraps
Fuck yeah it makes me mad
Fuck yeah I get upset
We're constantly ignored
Why the fuck I gotta pay for this
I don't want this war
How the Pentagon have six billion unaccounted for
But when I do my taxes I'm afraid to be a dollar short
I'm afraid I'll go to jail
I'm afraid I'll do some time
If I don't pay you back the money that you wasted that was mine
I can't keep quiet anymore
It's impossible to shut up
I'm sick and tired of being responsible for all your fuck ups

[Verse 6]
But the question is
What we gonna do about it
There's never a plan of action
All we seem to do is shout it
And I'm guilty of it too
Always bitching and complaining
Never walking, always talking
Always lipping off and saying
Im'ma do shit but I don't
And to be honest with you
That's the reason I don't make a lot of songs
And that's the truth
I'm sick of bumping my gums
I'm tired of flapping my jibs
Something needs to be done and I don't know if rapping is it
We need a real solution
But we need to get together first
Because unless we're all in this as a whole
It'll never work
However, what do I know?
I'm just a moron with a pen
But there's power in numbers
And there's more of us than them

[End]
The table is tilted folks
The game is rigged
And nobody seems to notice
Nobody seems to care
Good honest hard-working people
White Collar, Blue Collar
Doesn't matter what color shirt you have on
Continue to elect these rich cocksuckers
Who don't give a fuck about them
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't care about you at all at all at allEmbed"

There've been changes in this house
Things you don't know about in this family

You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense
The way things go

Sometimes two homes are better than one

If he need action, I make B Magic see 'matics then disappear
Now you done dropped into a pitfall
Rolled into a whirlpool and knocked into a brick wall
See now I'm getting pissed off
And I'm subject to pull his bitch card
'Cause we all know, he white-girl-brick soft
And I cave his fucking mouth in, so before this bout end he might get his shit sauced
I'm on my UFC shit, dog
Hop in his Octagon, and I'ma drop the bomb, Kris Kross
Soft-ass Crip, you'll talk that shit
This nigga probably bleed if I smacked him with my bitch cloth
Now get hard in the place
And I'm getting on yo' goof ass
Snapping six stars in yo' face, spitting on that flu rag
Vice Lord riding on him, shoot him when we shoot past
I'm in that super cool class, you know, Maseratis
And who the fuck got this Subaru gassed?
My connect cheap tickets, got me moving through bags
My team wit' it, we hit that I-7-5 route wit' a few [?]
Careful what you choose to do fag
'Cause all my b's vicious
And we keep biscuits for E-rickets
You got a motherfucking problem then leap cricket
But once that black and gold rag wrap that MAC and chrome mag, B listen this shit gon' be wicked
I slump him with the toast then, dump him in the ocean, send him deep-sea fishing
Listen, weapons from overseas, but the heat that we crep' in
A flip a fucking Mack Truck and make a Corvette bend

Little brother panicking, looking for the mag when we stepped in
Baby crying, baby ma breathless, she can't catch her next wind
Detectives on the block, asking niggas where we left in
And his mom going crazy, smacking on his best friend
So you should focus on the spoken lesson
'Fore you go boasting 'bout how yo' profession
Is toting weapons like you blow the Wesson
Now outta nowhere, I done got the urge for a little roasting session

Lieutenants, in this clique to clap ya' troops
You got a childish flow dog

I ain't even 'bout to try to out-punchline you 'cause I ain't a punchline nigga
Now see I just laugh at that
'Cause if he had the strap and I had the strap I'd dump mine's quicker
And front him one time I burn a TEC, and I bet these shots burn his chest like my gun fire liquor
See that's why I don't stress the stunting
'Cause I be in the Lou, I'll have a bitch catch him clubbing, get him slumped by a stripper
Bitch nigga, wanna scrap? Put your hands up then
And I dare anybody from yo' fam jump in
While you getting yo' shit ran up in
I ain't stabbing, I'm treating they face like cabinets: something I can put my cans up in
Now you talk that drug dealing crap but, how you dealing packs living in a shack Shaq couldn't stand up in
It's fakes in here, snakes is near I hear the rattle sound
Shottie lift him in the air, he gon' need a landing crew, or put him in the basement with his hands and shoes shackled down
Beef, I'm known to ground that cattle down
I will split your man in two, and in my hand it's two different cannons like Chicago Battlegrounds
Difference between me and this battle clown?
He gon' fight first, brag about how that left fast and that right worse
I'ma let that pipe squirt
Put him in the sky, make him fly how a kite work
I dug a hole, got a casket, got him some pants, a nice shirt
A tux I mean, 'cause I figure since he can't fuck with Qleen
He must like dirt
Light work!

Make you flip tryna get inside the mob crew
You gon' need heart from the start, get off my john Q
Nigga I will bomb you, you gon' die
You rap shitty, Rap City, I give Q fo'-fives
This Eagle I'ma show you how to make it scream
My next body like my room, I gotta make it Qleen

Hit this bish' up in his chest, I gotta play the king
My rhyme-saying mean, come in with the shovel
Give 'em nine, Johnny 5 how I'm rolling with the metal
Me and my niggas whooping ass when the [?] tough
Soon as I give my circle the word, cross puzzle
B Magic ain't gon' let a emcee breathe

This cannon gon' hurt nick when this emcee leave
If you don't like what I'm saying, then fight me now
See I was with your boo, see, and she wiped me down
Let's get to it, just do it, Nike style
Gave her the cool mo' d, so how you like me now?
He changed his name to Qleen, get cleaned the fuck out
If Qleen trip I'ma knock Qleen, clean the fuck out
Put on a handful of rings, swing and bust mouths
Blow everything in ya' skull out you fuck-mouth
The chopper pop him, if I don't hit his team
Get a mop when I pop, 'cause I won't miss the Qleen
B Magic is a dream, and when I go into a fight
A pair of nines'll make Caroline go into the light

[Round 3: Qleen Paper]
Ain't shit gravy in the future I see for Magic
So if you even speak of action or heater clapping then we gon' get it on like the Heat and Magic
Look doja I hit my foot-soldiers and pass 'em each a ratchet
And they click and 'Poof!' Magic
Before you even get to shoot, so fuck if you keep a maggie
'Cause what's the use of having heat to blast and you can't reach and grab it
Now you got these motherfuckers fooled
'Cause I don't know how you got in the Crips, but that's some decent acting I gotta admit
Till QP, been and been in that Impala with tints
And try to hit him with the fo', got him slipping in the snow
And if he try getting ghost, I'ma follow his prints
Plus, I'm touching everybody that you try to touch for help
Now I shoulda called and asked for a fee 'cause I lost the wealth
But aside from passing bags of fiend shit I wasn't doing nothing else
And now I'm getting back pissed off
'Cause this fat fuck reminding me of Rick Ross, thinking he everybody but his fucking self
You think you Aye Verb? Or Yung Ill?
Oh you Hitman? Boy you's a bum still
He is though, he spitting all them lazy lines
Sco peep, this the way he rhyme
""I'm shady guy, raised by killers back in '85
Crazy guy, nine stay cocked like McGrady's eye""
But even if you had that pistol pointed ready to let that 3-80 ride
Asking me questions like ""You tryna play me guy?""
I'm the type to throw him a late reply like ""Maybe why?""
If any of yo' mans hype, that's just gon' make it worse
You try to float, it's no hope, 'cause with that scope
I'ma far-sight you
Hit him, with a large rifle, spin him, like a wash cycle
Now stop it, you ain't profiting the cake
I pop him, leave nothing, for the coppers, not a trace
But if the Glock ain't on my waist, so I can pop him, in the face
I'ma slide him a buck fifty like he hopping on a freight
B Magic you got to be a real serious dude
Now you know goddamn well
It ain't no way in goddamn hell
That you fucking with Qleen, or on anybody block, tryna make a goddamn sale
Peep if you went with him to put in some work, guaranteed he gon' have you sitting in a goddamn cell
You tryna box and boogie, that's when I'ma reach the heat
Blow a chunk out yo' fat ass, take me a piece of meat
Now I usually do the whole three minutes, but since we all know B finished
This one I'ma keep discreet
Light work!

[Round 3: B Magic]
I will fuck this Highland Park High School student up
I will beat the dogshit outta Miles' little brother
You little midget fucker, 40 cal' let it air slow
Put the chopper in ya' wig, let's have a hair show
It's B Magic I hook yo' ass
Jab jab uppercut, I whoop yo' ass
I heard you did a 120 and they took yo' ass
Pay a lobby clerk to smoke you, Sam Cooke yo' ass
Play with me and get shells from the hawker
You fucking with a god, you'll get nailed if I cross ya'
D's gonna off ya', I be on key
It's Free World motherfucker, fuck 313
No canned good but this fruit cock tail
Boat with a hole in it, bitch you do not sell
Leave you neckless like that jeweler gave ya' medulla shells
It's Trey Crip, I'm the shit, if you do not smell
Qleen gon' make me pop the trunk and get that AK
And shoot this faggot vampire, you gay Blade
So why you talking like you popping in the park?
I realize he be lying I forgot he from Detroit
Who gon' move me Q?
Fucking ghost rapper, I'ma call you Susie Q
Little man don't understand what this Uzi do
Serial killer make niggas who acting fruity loop
I click-it-clock-it when I bing-bang shit
And leave ya' group handicapped on some Ying Yang shit
And Qleen he ain't shit, I leave you smoky if I'm robbing son
He gon' need some miracles for surviving this kinda gun
The Temptations from the D and a pistol, so the scope good enough to shoot Otis from a distance
Motown gon' be mad when this clique spit
Hop on stage and beat yo' ass, Trick-Trick
That fifth lift leave you holy, never hide mine
Because I rolls like Royce with these five nines
I'm guessing that the Motor City got a motormouth
Shooting at ya' shit-talkers tryna knock the motor out
I'm holding out, I ain't spitting what I can spit
Drag you on your head down the block: dance flick
Ya' mans get that big Glock till ya' wig pop
Beat me? Who from the D, gave this kid rock?
No Popeye's or Church's I get ya' chick boxed
Take this big L when this punisher hit you big, akh
Like a [?] twist ya' cap till ya' lid pop
You could get beat, or get clapped, over hip-hop
It's a wrap when that MAC hit your rib spot
If you wanna dance I got shooters like Rick Fox
You the type to play the wall, and dick-watch
I ride on him stop and get the rest, pit stopEmbed"
526,If By Chance,Safe Haven,Ruth B.,Sad,"I can't believe it's been all these years
I can't believe I've cried all these tears
My friends tell me I should've moved on
A long long time ago
But what do they know?
What do they know?

[Chorus]
And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

[Verse 2]
I wonder what happens when you hear our song
Do you brush it away or do you sing along?
Do you talk about the future the way we did?
Is there room for me in it?
Is there room for me in it?

You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

[Bridge]
Is it so wrong of me to hope she breaks your heart?
Is it so wrong of me to pray she tears you apart?
And I know that in the darkest part of you
You pray and hope and wish for it too

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't mean to be selfish
But your heart breaks every time
That you see me smile
'Cause you know that it's not you
Who brings it out of me anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past

I don't have to remember here
You're really close this time
I think it's better to keep in your head
All the things you tried to have
Maybe we already had the good times
Maybe we left them behind
So forget the way it made you feel
Don't forget it made you want to die

[Chorus]
And all these scars
Just won't ever seem to go away
Do you ever think about the way
All these things they used to be?
I think I lost it all out there
I think you know exactly what I mean

[Verse 2]
So I'll never go back
Do you wish they remember still?

Maybe you should save in your head

533,As Afterwards The Words Still Ring - 91 Version,Complete Discography,Moss Icon,Sad,"Like a spreading serpent, tentacled and silent
We hear the speak of the angel as she settles on down to hallowed earth, saying
""Begin those labors of contentment and ease.""
As she walks forward, slowly
Or is it the wind?
Chiming through the mobile composed of drifted wood?
Or is it the wind?
Chiming through the mobile composed of drifted wood?
You ask a question

Collecting shells along the pebbled beach
Cannot have paved the way for this afternoon's fright
Oh no

Although our eyes find acute solitude while affixed on the oyster shell
The vision all around
And enveloping the shell is indeed a chaotic slaughter of color and black definition
There is an explosion, a crashing rain and a collapse of earth
Burning white as sun bleached sand on the eyes of the metallic incense
The snow is beginning to fall

Many particled and infinite
The snow is meeting the hardended clay and sand
Many particled and infinite
The snow is meeting the hardended clay and sand
In many instants of transformational kissing
The snow meets the creek
In many instants of transformational kissing
The snow meets the creek
There is a man trudging his shattered way
Along the far side of that creek
Moving closer, we see that the man has been beaten and bloodied
Although it is well into the early hours of darkness
We see that the man is a black man
An African who has been enslaved
An African who has been enslaved and broken from his mother's side
A human being dragging frozen iron chains and ankle braces
Through the near freezing water of the creek
Earlier he had made the decision that frozen feet are better than feet ripped worn
Ripped and shredded worn by the mouths of crazed bloodhounds
So now he trudges

As she walks forward slowly
Or is it the wind?
Or is it just the wind chiming through the mobile?
A curse can be heard coming from the man's palsied lips
The snow will soon be collecting on the ground
And when that happens, the hunters won't even need the aid of the tracking dogs anymore
But they'll keep them
You can hear them say
""Ain't nothing like a nigga before the dog""
Damn the snow

Inspired and driven by his hallowed sister moon
Breaking this container as the dogs break the container coccoon
I am alive
After its recession there is a deepness to the tide
After a life of spirit's tangibility has died
As after the lungs
As after the cold
As after the cold when they poison their heads deep
Life the spring
As afterwards the words still ring
As afterwards the words still ring
I am aliveEmbed"
534,Bread,"Today Puberty, Tomorrow The World",Native Nod,Sad,"I rationalise my shaking legs and feet
As a constant rhythm flowing through my head
But that doesn't explain my tight neck and oily pores on my back
My spine is clearly pleading for release
No, it's not just a song
It's definitely not just a song

[Verse 2]
It's a beat and it's racing past your pad, through your pad
At light speed, rendering everything in its path obsolete

A tension tugging at my smile?

I'm sure I missed it by a mile

[Chorus 1]
Swallowed in some detail, heavy in my blood
I want to hold you close but I can't lift my arms up

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason for this distance?
More than the drug that floats my days
A nervous bug in my system
It keeps me edgy and ashamed

[Chorus 2]
I've got a saint, never ever will forgive
That never understood me but still tells me how to live
It fits when I stretch and I stretch because I can

[Bridge 1]
I stretch until I'm sore and then I open up for more
I do it out of habit, not addiction
And if I give it up, clean out my blood
Will I still feel bored and disconnected?

How come it upsets you so?
Shouldn't it be me who feels uneased?
How come you first think of my health?
Trying to forget...

The second they close and I'm in my cold bed
""Keep your feet away from me,"" you said
Trying to close you out of my cold head

Effortlessly as the burden of his sunken child is lifted
But effortlessly again carried
Faintly to the stone heart of an angry son
An angry son who has done his swallowing
His memories are bitten pills
So many bitten pills
That he has collected
Like the fallen pieces of the broken ground which he now moves on
The ground is so unsettled
So endlessly unsettled
He recounted
With the weight of the sunken earth
And still he moves on
This is Earth
Earth which he has moved on and collected
Settled to his own liking
And still he moves on
A voice in the back of his head reminding him
That this is stolen
That this is not his
All these moments
These precious time spent moments in gravity
All this anxious waiting
All this time spent waiting
All this pain that you know
All this effortless moving
All this pain that you will ever know

540,New Birds,Philophobia (Deluxe Version),Arab Strap,Sad,"
I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds

She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out

But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week
You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thingSee Arab Strap LiveGet tickets as low as $161You might also like1Embed"

The floor is covered in long blonde curls

On afternoons I walk the graves
The rusted cars, the mineshaft caves
See a girl sadly unkempt
A child of neglect

Under moons I pass the tombs
Cross the highways, smell the fumes
See a girl, frighteningly gaunt, somebody didn't want
How do I tell her I don't care if she sleeps downstairs?

I see her on my errand runs
Looking nervous, like a young Mia Farrow

As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me

In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend

Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

From an allergic reaction to a general anaesthetic

Waiting for the tide
To drag her to the ocean, to another sea's shore
This thing hurts like hell
But what did you expect?

[Chorus: Los Campesinos!]
And all you can hear
Is the sound of your own heart
And all you can feel
Is your lungs flood and the blood course
But, oh, I can see
Five-hundred years dead set ahead of me
Five-hundred behind
A thousand years in perfect symmetry

Best known left wrist, right finger through all the Southern states
On every video games machine, they call her triple-A
There were racists on the radio, trying to give up smoking
The chat show host, he joked
""You have to wait for the government program""
Talk about your politics
And I wonder if you could be one of them
But you could never kiss a Tory boy
Without wanting to cut off your tongue again

[Verse 4: Gareth]
A good place to look to the future
Is when you are sat at the sea
With the salt up to your ankles
And a view of the end of the pier
You may look down at your model's feet
And wish that you’d just float away
And the weather here is overcast
And the sea is the same shade of grey
So the landscape before you
Looks just like the edge of the world
But to the left side and the right side
Either way is a crazy golf course
The sea is a good place (The sea is a good place)
To think of, to think about the future
[Chorus: Los Campesinos!]
And all you can hear
Is the sound of your own heart
And all you can feel
Is your lungs flood and the blood course
But, oh, I can see
Five-hundred years dead set ahead of me
Five-hundred behind
A thousand years in perfect symmetry
A thousand years, no getting rid of me
A thousand years in perfect symmetry14Embed"
565,Epitaph (Black and Blue),The Silver Tongued Devil and I,Kris Kristofferson,Sad,"Lord, ain't it a shame
Grievin' together
Sharin' the blame

But when she was dyin'
Lord, we let her down
There's no use cryin'
It can't help her now

The party's all over
Drink up and go home
It's too late to love her
And leave her alone

Just say she was someone
Lord, so far from home
Whose life was so lonesome
She died all alone

Who dreamed pretty dreams
That never came true
Lord, why was she born
So black and blue

Oh, why was she born
So black and blueYou might also likeEmbed"
566,Real Death,A Crow Looked at Me,Mount Eerie,Sad,"Someone's there and then they're not
And it's not for singing about
It's not for making into art
When real death enters the house
All poetry is dumb
When I walk in
To the room where you were
And look into
The emptiness instead
All fails
My knees fail
My brain fails
Words fail
Crusted with tears, catatonic and raw, I go downstairs and outside and you still get mail
A week after you died a package with your name on it came and inside was a gift for our daughter you had ordered in secret and collapsed there on the front steps I wailed
A backpack for when she goes to school a couple years from now. You were thinking ahead to a future you must have known deep down would not include you though you clawed at the cliff you were sliding down, being swallowed into a silence that's bottomless and real
It's dumb
And I don't want to learn anything from this
I love youYou might also like21Embed"

It's a long time since I drank champagne
The ocean is blue, as blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

[Verse 2]
Old long since gone, now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
There ain't no good thing ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

[Bridge]
Far, far away a train whistle blows
Wherever you're goin', wherever you've been
Waving goodbye at the end of the day
You're up and you're over and you're far away

Always for you, forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beulah's porch
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

All your crying can't do me no good
Just lower me down with a quick sad goodbye
Pour in the black Texas mud

570,God Damn The Sun,Various Failures,Swans,Sad,"When, when we were young
We had no history, so nothing to lose
Meant we could choose, choose what we wanted then
Without any fear or thought of revenge
But then you grew old, and I lost my ambition
So I gained an addiction, to drink and depression
They are mine, my only true friends
And I'll keep them with me until the very end
I'd choose not to remember, but I miss your arrogance
And I need your intelligence, and your hate for authority
But now you're gone, I read it today
They found you in Spain, face down in the street
With a bottle in your hand and a wild smile on your face
And a knife in your back, you died in a foreign land
And they found my letter rolled up in your pocket
Where I said I'd kill myself if she left me again
So now she's gone, and you're both in my mind
I've got one thing to say before I am drunk again

580,Hazey Jane I,Bryter Layter,Nick Drake,Sad,"Do you curse where you come from? Do you swear in the night?
Would it mean much to you if I treat you right?
Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more?
Or will you stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?

[Chorus]
Hey slow, Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence
[Verse 2]
Do you feel like a remnant of something that's past?
Do you find things are moving just a little too fast?
Do you hope to find new ways of quenching your thirst?
Do you hope to find new ways of doing better than your worst?

[Chorus]
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move

[Bridge]
Do it for you
Sure that you would do the same for me one day
So try to be true
Even if it's only in your hazey way

Can you tell if you're moving with no mirror to see?
If you're just riding a new man who looks a little like me
Is it all so confusing? Is it hard to believe?
When the winter is coming can you sign up and leave

[Chorus]
Hey slow, Jane, clear your eye
Slow, slow, Jane, fly on by3Embed"
581,These Days,Chelsea Girl,Nico,Sad,"I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to

[Verse 2]
I stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway

[Verse 3]
I had a lover
I don't think I risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long

I'd stopped my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to 10

I had not forgotten themEmbed"
582,Late for the Sky - Remastered,Late for the Sky (Remastered),Jackson Browne,Sad,"And somehow the feeling still wasn't right
And still we continued on through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand how our lives had led us there
Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone
Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch
You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be
Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known
How long've I been sleeping?
And how long've I been drifting alone through the night?
How long've I been dreaming I could make it right?
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might
To be the one you need
Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known
How long've I been sleeping?
How long've I been drifting alone through the night?
How long've I been running for that morning flight?
Through the whispered promises and the changing light
Of the bed where we both lie late for the skyYou might also likeEmbed"

584,Surf's Up - Remastered 2009,Surf's Up,The Beach Boys,Sad,"It's Charron vs. Cornell
You 'bout to get owned, I been known
On TV but this home
You think I'd turn my back on battle rap? I ain't that bitch Rone
Flip mo'
Bitch don't
Sleep on me because of my skin tone
Rum got the kid fucked up; fetal alcohol syndrome
They said it's Real Deal for the chain, I'm raisin' my voice
I'm the one makin' y'all noise
Trevor don't want this smoke with Corey, it ain't the Trailer Park Boys
You'se a fake Crip, and you and I different
I know why he didn't throw up that C for (C-4), this a suicide mission
I ain't a new bull, resume long as Manute Bol
I'll break down this Crip 'til he see (C) R.I.P. on his tombstone
Real Deal, Fresco, who's home?
I'll have Danny Myers on ice, I'm too cold!
What up Boss Town?
Been in this league since 17, won't stop now
I'm Bigg K on Twitter, all I do is hold the block down
I got a playbook for all you bitches, I'm Barney Stinson
They'll see (C) how I took K out, I started Crippin'
And now it's ""bye Pass"" (bypass); heart condition
They gave me an award (A. Ward), that was a stupid death; Darwinism
He's hardly winnin'
Bet against Charron then I'm chargin' a bag
It ain't a car collision
When it cost you AngryFans an arm and a leg
Yo 'Ganik, I spent 200K for Oxxxy, this a body round 1
You're a shitty bartender, I asked for a white Russian and got a watered down Rum
Crew hoppin', that's what he is about
You rep Homi, 4th Quarter, LSC? You need a key for some help
I'm Old School like Will Farrell, I'm on the street by myself
Ain't no helpin' ya, dead bodies, selfin' ya
The way I'm doin' Rum? HAM, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia
That racist angle, cut it out right now
Don't say this for El Paso or justice for Mike Brown
If I see a racist pig, I'll get mine
Instead of a black kid, I hope it's a crooked cop next time
The motto has always been ""Fuck 12""; Tech 9
Callin' me racist isn't a great style
I still think Lotto beat Rabbit in 8 Mile
Against A. Ward it was Wu-Tang; Killah Priest
Now it's Yung Joc; Nitti (Nitty) beats
Was supposed to be Bachir but I'm a different beast
Yo Cambridge, you know you're the man when Dizaster ducks you in the Middle East
I hope your son throws up a ""B"" on his next exam
Pay my shooters an extra grand
You Rum in the Middle East, that only gets you Banned
It ain't home sweet home when this Desert land
Take the C out when I put the K to Corn' (Korn); metal band
They say he's the ""Patriot of gun bars"" this for the Brady fans
Soon as I Drew, he bled so (Bledsoe) much they replaced the man
I call this ""Belichick"", with the 12 I had a crazy plan
But this 12's been ringin' so much I just start changin' hands
They say you're the ""MJ of gun bars"" to me that's not important
They said the same with K, peep my Roc performance
This a mirror match, you wear fake J's and I knock of Jordans
The URL Killer, they forgot the motto
No one wants to see this white boy black; Tom MacDonald
I do the job, you don't keep it real yourself
You decide, suicide, just look at me when you kill yourself
You might also like[Round 1: Rum Nitty]
I'm 'bout to pull two thumpers out and slap you
All you hear is the beats up top, don't be fuckin' up the battle
After this, you're 'bout to get everything outta the tool
I'll trail you, to your car and pull your card

[Geechi]
What is you doin'?

[Rum]
Followin' suit
Aye we got Rum Nitty, ""Mr. .50 Blam""...lift the can'...trigger hands

At least a couple of 'em, y'all knew what it was
Billy Pistolz? Man how you get bodied in Bodied?; Buddy Love
I ain't finna take ya light world, I'm a motherfuckin' monster, these niggas type scary
Cause I'm beastin' (bee sting) on everything; Macaulay Culkin in My Girl
Every Fucking Bar
I don't think ya dawg shootin'
But if you are shootin', I'll pull up and air back out the window; swamp cooler
I won't even let the squad do it, I got two K's (2K), but I ain't tryin' to pass the sticks, I'm a sore loser
Your boy's stupid, clueless, use ya mind
You starin' at a GOAT; George Clooney
Aye, I know you not active really, so I'm not listenin' to what this faggot tell me
I can't hear you, I'm deaf (death) to the fake; Machiavelli
I'll fuck around and slap Charron
Clap Charron
Sniper rifle posted, scopin'
I'll see where you at Charron
I'm watchin' over you with super vision (supervision); this shit a chaperone
This nigga look up to Pat Stay, but he don't really try to
He's in denial
It makes sense, that punk known for rock, of course he's Billy Idol
Lift the rifle
Spot you, vitiligo
Loud shot, fucked up my hearing; I'm skippin' trial
I'm skippin' trial, aye, if a nigga try you, dawg get aired
Pull up, in the midnight ridin', let off the steel
Somethin' from the Taurus, tore through his House; Paul Revere
This my motherfuckin' spot for real
You either move on or get moved out
You Tommy Pickles lookin' in the face ass
Don't make me pull up with the tool out
Palm the grip, .38, infrared on the tip
Now there is a light that shines on it special for you, use your Common sense
You're gonna die fam'
You finna die fam'
I'll send you to Jesus, become an angel, I made you winged (wing it); improvised plan
Lift up my cans
Two Smith's, I'll shoot 'em at will (Will); Gemini Man
Don't play wit' me
They like, ""Nitty, you 'bout to go put on a show for them white folks?""
I Will, and Grace-fully
Blade wit' me, get stuck by ya side; faithfully
Then get it all in ya head since you make believe
Smokin' shit what I be on, to be Frank, Nitty ran with Al Capone (Kapone)
Bitch, you can't keep it real yourself
(Suicide or I'll do the job, you decide, kill yourself!)
Bitch!
[Round 2: Charron]
Aye, aye, aye, he says all I do is film references, I guess you want some more movies
Always starin' at a GOAT, you think he's George Clooney
Well guess who killed him? Yours truly
See people, they don't really wanna get that 'til I put it to his melon
You got your hands up like you don't know, I ain't gonna tell on ya
Tommy Pickles, one punch, swellin' ya
I'm lookin' down on this little kid; Angelica
They say he's the GOAT puncher, he had one that really move me
Against Tax you said, ""Your sister's the biggest groupie
She gave the whole town dome like, The Simpson's Movie
That bar flames
But how you gon' steal a line I used against Arcane?
Both bars bit and I give a fuck when you start Crippin'
Out of principle I'll give this C more (Seymour) problems than Bart Simpson
Your girl lets every mister (Mr.) Plow, it's a nice old job
She rakes in more with her head than Sideshow Bob
That was my line, why'd you take it though?
Stole my idea, now I'm lightin' Rum up, that's a flamin' bowl
Shuttin' Rum down like Rex Banner
The right? Hit like a sledge hammer
Well I got somethin' for every left hander like Ned Flanders
If we heat grippin' I'll deep ditch him
I'm stupid with the gun; Chief Wiggum
When this auto (Otto) bust (bus) all your kids go
Let a clip blow
I just registered the Maggie, Simpsons intro
See I didn't write a segue to get into these gun bars sooo it's Pistolz time
Bigga .9
You Crippin'? Now your team is dead
Put a bullet in Geechi's head
It's like I'm guessin' in multiple choice, I'm just fillin' up C's with lead
Crazy, don't know what to think
You start shoot-
Look at me when I'm killing you!
Look at me when I'm killing you!
[Rum Nitty]
You're losing

[Charron]
Crazy, don't know what to think, start shootin', I won't even blink
I'll pull out the Sig' (cig') after Rum, I only smoke when I drink
Sorry Player, we'll get to those fake Jordans later
The first couple rounds, Corey's favor
White boy in Boston, 2-0; Gordon Hayward
And don't rebuttal it by dunkin' neither
Your girl knew I'm from Toronto, I just fuck and leave her
Soon as I shoot my shot, she sat on it...I'm Kawhi with that buzzer beater
Hoop season, casket, that's what you leave in
Ya crew leakin', I'm the opposite of my mom's food, I'm too seasoned
I battled Twork on five days didn't miss a step, I had flips on deck
I'm like the URL, I'm even better without Prep
Is we Crippin' yet? Your sister blue (blew), didn't hit it yet
Red Stripe bottle, just got a little neck
Don't interject, I never stall
Geechi? Don't get involved
I got bodies inside of bodies; Russian nesting doll
It's death for y'all
They wanna do this, but watch how I'm checkin' y'all
I'm the most deadly think mixed with SMACK since Fentanyl
Eff your whole style, the SMACK Killer, his death was so vile
You gettin' drug up and down Mass Ave, this the Methadone Mile
I'm always there to ride ain't scared of crime, I never snitch, I'm prepared for time
This white boy wouldn't sing if they put on 'Sweet Caroline'
Rum pourin' on the pavement, R.I.P
They start to scream and put this pussy on a shirt; Carter Deems
With the hardest team, I got a family full of animals; Arthur Reed
Scratch that, all you see is the fist; Arthur meme
Do you want a blade or an arm from me?
It's Rum shot, Rum shot, this Bacardi's free
Or put a knife to son and start spikin' Rum like Cardi B
Whether it's the Chef or Chilla, this is up my lane
Drake curse, when I'm in the picture it switches up the game
I'll flip another house, you can flip another name
The real Gun Bar King; Billy Pistolz for the chain
Pistol!

[Round 2: Rum Nitty]
You know we slide, lookin' fo' these guys
How many? Four or five
Get in, we goin' on a ride
Pull up, put that bitch in park
When They See Us, you better hope Corey (Korey) Wise
I upped the Sig', bust ya lid, nothin' lives
I got many bodies with this machine, Honey, I Shrunk The Kids
I ain't finna play, niggas keep throwin' shots back and forth, 'til one ricochet
Better try to get away, before I draw on you and leave your skull filled (Scofield) like Prison Break
You 'bout to get all the smoke
And take so many punches the fans yellin'
(Get off the ropes!)
You gon' make me throw you on a shirt
You a SMACK killer? Smack killers, roll you in the dirt
Before you go into your verse, I got a box, you can go into it first
I give you the whole plot, early; spoiler alert
I'm on alert! My face covered, you can't tell who it is
And niggas know, when that mass occur (Massacre) it's finna get messy in here
Grenade launch the stage, I bet he get killed
Blow the whole set up Boston; Derek Foreal
You niggas should kneel, cause hate it or not, I'm the motherfuckin' king of the spot
I'm sorry 'Ms. Jackson', niggas can't stop my reign (rain) at the top
I'll hit Bigg K wit' a shot, gave that ginger L's (ales); now this Canadian pop
You better catch the record straight, y'all gon' make me catch a case
Big ass FN 57 stretch you, this shit heavyweight
Billy Pistolz bet' not every play
But I won't even clip you, I'll just backhand Pistolz, like Kevin Gates
Aw fuck, you all stuck, AR's bust
We get a green light when it smoke, my vape pen charged up
Dawg, what?
Ya dawg what? You kiddin', right?
We really Crippin', that mean shit'll go left, we ain't livin' right
But this is life
So let you bring some problems to the hood, I'll leave you popped up and dash; check engine light
Aye, I ain't missin' shit tonight
I hit everything with these two .9's blazin'
Are you crazy? I hold the shot record, immunization
Bang him
""Spit yo' shit!""

[Round 3: Charron]
Aye they say Rum Nitty give you that sorta feel
Well I feel they sorta down playin' Corey's skill
He said they gon' ""take so many punches they'll scream 'get off the ropes'"", that's more than real
'Til I do a rope a dope and I'll leave (Ali) ya with a Foreman Grill
Every Rum verse is the same to me
You think Cornell would have multiple subjects, no angles/schemes
Just gun line after gun line uncreatively
You're from Arizona, you should have it covered from A to Z
Break him down, fuck if he acts tougher, none of your schemes have structure
I talk to you while I punch like the Diaz Brothers
It's just name flip after name flip every line's about guns
Nothing's more intimidating than a guy who does puns
Conceited, Heartless, did this in '09 before Rum
Funny you're from Phoenix and stole your whole style from The Suns (S.O.N.S.)
Let me guess, you went light on me today, don't matter the league I'll lead the way
Charron's the most consistent, that's what people say
I always give you a little somethin' somethin', it's in my DNA
See it's Charron versus another SMACK rapper
Nah they got it ass backwards
You ain't a SMACK rapper, you're a KOTD backstabber
You and Danny was GZ, KOTD released it quick
They gave you Magic and O-Red, you seem legit
'Til you signed exclusive with SMACK, turned your back on this league and dipped
You wanna be the Gun Bar King like Tay but never squeezed the clip
Joe Dirt I'm exposing this fake Roc(k) as a piece of shit
Who would know Rum? If it wasn't for us, no one
They funded his whole run
You can't copy respect- but you can show some
Aye, let's play Swear To God, I want you to answer me
Swear To God that URL didn't block ya battle with Cassidy

[Rum Nitty]
Swear to God

[Charron]
A. Ward he's sinning. That's a lie right now
You swear to God?
Nah I swear to God because that was locked in, they nearly paid you
You broke your contract-
Don't put your hands up, everything I say is true
They had that contract, they had to renege you
Now it's Da Rebel vs. Cas', they had to erase you
How you the Gun Bar King when an Arsonal replaced you?
You snaked King Of The Dot for SMACK, thought it'd be a helluva look
Then went back, now your biggest match the URL wouldn't book?
All those guns, just to shoot yourself in the foot?
You traded Cassidy for a Charron battle?
Whoo, I'ma motherfuckin' beast
They picked Ars' and you offered lower fees
It's in London, England you could've bodied bro with ease
How are you a Crip when you let the URL block you overseas (over C's)
But lately, I've seen my haters come out
They say I have bad set ups, that's something I straight up just doubt
They say, ""All he does is current event bars"", it's misleading I've been beastin'
Don't do current event bars kids
You may end up on MTV for six seasons
""He doesn't know what to do with his hands"", that couldn't be more true
Everybody makes fun of how I rap, even Ward too
If I worked on my performance, I'd have more views
I'm just pointin' fingers, like Tsu Surf in the court room
SMACK come put a leash on your bitch
Bought my house in cash, don't have a mortgage
You need a permission slip to become one of my corpses
Check my net worth, holler at me when you're rich
I'm Forbes list, you ain't even Norbes list
You're on his ignore list
See, goin' punch for punch ain't how I'm runnin' him this fade
I'm playin' defense, fuckin' up his aim
Mike Tyson on NES, I'm usin' the right angles to beat the best puncher in the game
Fuckin' Small Blart, you gon' rap 'bout what?
You've been the Gun Bar King for years, ain't pulled your MAC out once
I did Twork dirty, he had to act out stuff
I've been outbarring Rum all night, I'm blackout drunk!

[Round 3: Rum Nitty]
Aye, are you thinkin' you 'bout to get this win tonight?
Doubtful
The only way you walkin' out this event alive, if I allow you
Turn up the volume
Somethin' loud shoot
Hittin' everything around you
Big shit for real
I lick wit' (liquid) the steel, it's what it all boils down to
You ain't got no piece please stop it
He weak, need to retreat 'fore we squeeze on him
If he keep talkin', two from the .9
Stomach shots, they brewin' (Bruin) inside; TD Garden
I won't stall him
It's the biggest clip that I show up to your apartment building wit'
Takin' layers off the complex, since they say I'm too intricate
Silencer on the little fifth

[fake stumbles]

Silencer on the little fifth, keep bringin' it up like I can't forget the shit
And you ain't never gonna hear the end of it
Aye, they say, ""You better not play with Charron
You better go in every line
Gun bars, let 'em fly, he better die""
If you had me losin' to this bitch you was tellin' lies
I won't let it slide
Y'all gon' make me steel (steal) a nigga in Boston like Celtic Pride
Two Berettas gonna squeeze
I-I-I'll kill a man, I'm close to the edge with these bitches, Thelma & Louise
You niggas is hoes, gettin' exposed
Let a nigga go all in ya pockets, get hit wit' the pole
Rob you for all the shit that you hold
Everything in ya Possession? You better raise up off it, like Emily Rose
I'll fire at your tee (T), Antichrist
Bringin' sticks was my intent (in tent); camping site
I shoot it at an angle, I don't clap it right
I'm flashin' to the side, like hazard lights
Try you get hit, I don't play no games, I'm sideline on a bench
Slide wit' the stick, .9 finna lift
Gun up, I'll run up and (in) air; bicycle kick
Slide by the crib like ""Somebody gettin' buried now.""
If I pull up airin', like a furniture truck, this whole section'll (sectional) get carried out
Catch a round, whole S50, dome shot
The face on ya man cave (mancave), there ain't no bitch in me
You can't keep it real yourself

586,When I Loved Her,The Silver Tongued Devil and I,Kris Kristofferson,Sad,"And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of makin' me believe that I belonged
And it felt like comin' home, when I found her

'Cause she seemed to be so proud of me just walkin' holdin' hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feelin' warm, when I loved her

'Cause she brightened up the day like the early mornin' sun
And she made what I was doin' seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to livin' that I guess I've ever known
And it made me want to smile, when I loved her

I know some of us were born to cast our fortune to the winds
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand, why I lost herYou might also likeEmbed"

594,I Trawl the Megahertz,I Trawl the Megahertz,Prefab Sprout,Sad,"Stranger than song or fiction
We start with the joyful mysteries
Before the appearance of ether
Trying to capture the elusive
The farm where the crippled horses heal
The woods where autumn is reversed
And the longing for bliss in the arms
Of some beloved from the past
I said 'Your daddy loves you.'
I said 'Your daddy loves you very much...
He just doesn't want to live with us anymore.'

The plane comes down behind enemy lines
And you don't speak the language
A girl takes pity on you
She is Mother Theresa walking among the poor
And her eyes have attained night vision
In an orchard, drenched in blue light
She changes your bandages and soothes you
All day her voice is balm
Then she lowers you into the sunset
Hers is the wing span of the quotidian angel
So her feet are sore from the walk
To the well of human kindness
But she gives you a name, and you grow into it
Whether a tramp of the low road or a prince
Riding through Wagnerian opera
You learn some, if not all, of the language
And these are the footsteps you follow
The tracks of impossible love
You might also likeTwelve days in Paris, and I'm awaiting for life to start
In the lobby of the Hotel Charlemagne
They're hanging photographs
Of rap artists and minor royalty
All cigarettes have been air-brushed from these pictures
Making everyone a liar
And saving no-one from their folly
As proud as Lucifer, I do nothing to hide
My kerosene dress and flint eyes
Which one steady look, are able to restore
To these images their carcinogenic threat
So what if this is largely bravado?
I have only twelve days in Paris, and I'm waiting for life to start
I'm setting out my stall behind a sheet of dark hair
And you, the hostage of crazed hormones
Will be driven to say:
'I am the next poet laurate
And she is the cherry madonna
And all of the summer is hers.'

At first I don't notice you
Or the colour of your hair
Or your readiness to laugh
I am tying a shoelace
Or finding the pavement fascinating
When the comet thrills the sky
Ever the dull alchemist
I have before me all the neccesary elements
It is their combination that eludes me
Forgive me, I am sleepwalking
I am jangling along to some song of the moment
Suffering it's sweetness
Luxuriating in it's feeble aproximation of starlight
Meanwhile there is a real world
Trains are late, doctors are breaking bad news
But I am living in a lullaby
You might be huddled in a doorway on the make
Or just getting by, but I don't see it
You are my one shot at glory
Soon I will read in your expression
Warmth, encouragement, assent
From an acorn of interest
I will cultivate whole forests of affection
I will analyse your gestures
Like centuries of scholars
Pouring over Jesus' words
Anything that doesn't fit my narrow interpretation
I will carelessly discard
For I am careless, I'm shameless, and
'Mayday, Mayday, watch the needle leave the dial'
I am reckless, I am telling myself the story of my life

Soon, I will make you a co-conspirator
If I am dizzy I will call it rapture
If I am low I will attribute it to your absence
Noting your tidal effect upon my moods
Oblivious to the opinions of neighbours
I will bark at the moon like a dog
In short, I'm asking to be scalded
It is the onset of fever

Yesterday they took a census
Boasting, I said 'I live two doors down from joy.'
Today, bewildered and sarcastic, I phone them and ask
'Isn't it obvious? This slum is empty.'
Repeat after me: happiness is only a habit
I am listening to the face in the mirror
But I don't think I believe what she's telling me
Her words are modern, but her eyes have been weeping
In gardens and grottoes since the Middle Ages
This is the aftermath of fever
I cool the palms of my hands upon the bars
Of an imaginary iron gate
Only by an extreme act of will can I avoid
Becoming a character in a country song
'Lord, you gave me nothing, then you took it all away.'
These are the sorrowful mysteries
And I have to pay attention
In a chamber of my heart sits an accountant
He is frowning and waving red paper at me
I go to the window for air
I catch the scent of apples, I hunger for a taste
But I can't see the orchard for the rain

There are two ways of looking at this
The first is to accept that you are gone
And to light a candle at the shrine of amnesia
I could even cheat
In the subterranean world of anaesthetics
Sad white canoes are forever sailing downstream
In the early hours of the morning
'Tell the stars I'm coming, make them leave a space for me
Whether bones, or dust, or ashes...
Once among them I'll be free.'
It may make a glamorous song
But it's a dark train of thought with too many carriages

There is, of course
Another way of looking at this
'Your daddy loves you,' I said
'Your daddy loves you very much
He doesn't want to live with us anymore.'
I am telling myself the story of my life

By day and night
Fancy electronic dishes are trained on the heavens
They are listening for smudged echoes of the moment of creation
They are listening for the ghost of a chance
They may help us make sense of who we are and where we came from
And, as a compassionate side effect
Teach us that nothing is ever lost

So, I rake the sky
I listen hard
I trawl the megahertz
But the net isn't fine enough, and I miss you
A swan sailing between two continents
A ghost immune to radar

Still, my eyes are fixed upon the place I last saw you
Your signal urgent but breaking
Before you became cotton in a blizzard
A plane coming down behind enemy linesEmbed"

Pushing away

And touch we touched the soul

606,Rituals,Blessed Suffering,Pill Friends,Sad,"Sitting across from you and coming down again
I hear you say goodbye as you walk into the woods
I know the dogs will find you and they’ll lick your bones all clean
Invoking silent screams as their teeth hit your flesh
Passively devoured for redemption lies in death
I’ll go out later and find your lifeless form
Put it on the altar and practice rituals

King of hell in everyone
In the places I go and the things that I see
Emotionless, I breathe your air and learn to trust nothing
Detached, I pray to you
Forgive me for nothing
Forget me, I’m nothing

Frays of friction far too sacred
We survive between our hunger
Dig our heads into the water
Memorize your casket, your mother patterns
The space between your legs, I grab what's good of you
You pluck fruit from my endless head
Rearrange them to make your soul sweat
Bite snakes down for better shelter
Fridge your orgasm, make it colder

[Verse 2]
We put our blood in bags, we don't want water
And you hold me close inside the slaughter
And you look so much better without that shit in your hair
I mean, saddles if you need them, but I could ride you bare
And you can swallow shotguns if you want to
There are bullets in your paintings, if you want them
There are hooks to hang your kill
There are floodboards rising upwards
And fields our fathers fled from
And bedrooms we don't dare go to

One step inside doesn't mean you'll understand
One step inside doesn't mean I'm yours

And my arms won't move, my hands won't grab
I will never read your stupid map

634,Smells Like Content,Lost and Safe (Remastered),The Books,Sad,"Composition, mirrors
Most of all the world is a place
Where parts of wholes are described
Within an overarching paradigm of clarity
And accuracy
The context of which makes possible
An underlying sense of the way it all fits together
Despite our collective tendency not to conceive of it as such
But then again
The world without end
Is a place where souls are combined
But with an overbearing feeling of disparity
Disorderliness
To ignore it is impossible
Without getting oneself
Into all kinds of trouble
Despite one's best intentions
Not to get entangled with it so much
And meanwhile the statues are bleeding green
And others are saying things
Much better than we ever could
As the quiet becomes suddenly verbose
You might also likeAnd the hail is heralding the size of nickels
And the street corners are gnashing together
Like gears inside the head
Of some omniscient engineer
And downward flows the garnered wisdom
That has never died
When finally we opened the box
We couldn't find any rules
Our heads were reeling with a glut of possibilities
Contingencies
But with ever increasing faith
We decided to go ahead and just ignore them
Despite tremendous pressure to capitulate and fade

So instead we went ahead
To fabricate a catalogue
Of unstable elements
And modicums
And particles with non-zero total strangeness
For brief moments which amount
To nothing more than tiny fragments of a finger snap
And meanwhile we're furiously sleeping green
And the map has started tearing along its creases due to overuse
When in reality, it's never needed folds
And the air's withholding the sound
Of its wellspring
And our heads are approaching a density
Reminiscent of the infinite connectivity of the center of the sun
And therein lies the garnered wisdom
That has never died
Expectation leads to disappointment
If you don't expect something big, huge, and exciting then usually
Uh
I don't know, it's just not as, yeah2Embed"
635,Exterminata Beat,Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform,Emperor X,Sad,"It's not the strongest, but it's all we could afford
We'll treat it carefully and monitor close
If we see an infestation we'll be sure to do some damage on it

And while I'm at it, friend, I'll write you a note-
Strip off some laminate and give you some hope
I hope you survive this- you likely won't
The crossbeams need some treatment, so we put them under pressure

And they fall away
Beams yield. Boards break
The floor planks vibrate. House shakes

You hit the pound, I'm sure you like it a lot
You peel the paint off the walls 'cause you're afraid to rock
Collecting all the signatures you need to purify your data

It's been awhile since I've seen you this clean, and that disturbs me
I don't know what it means
How far along are you in your pregnancy?

You call his name

637,Dead Dogs Two - Boards of Canada remix,Well Deep: Ten Years Of Big Dada,cLOUDDEAD,Sad,"From the height of the highway on-ramp we saw
Two dogs a-dead in a field
Glowing on the Oakland Coliseum green seats wasteland
Dogs, dogs we thought were dead
They rose up, rose up when whistled at
Their rib cage inflating
Like men on the beach being photographed
A guard dog (guard dog) for what? (for what?)
Against overzealous penniless athletics fanatics
Getting into games through a hole in the fence
For the owner of the blue tarp tent
Pitched by a creek beneath the on-ramp
In the privacy of the last three
Skin-and-bony trees, devoid of leaves
And us undeceased, and with our new CDs
Zipping on dead east, Oakland

[Chorus]
It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead
Under a sky so blue
You have to stop the blood to your head
To fit the breath in front of you

To long to be dead
Center of a curious crowd

Straight up settles on your raw muscle tissue

And drawing brand new maps
Discreetly expanding their nations borders

652,Lovesong - 2010 Remaster,Disintegration (2010 Remaster),The Cure,Sad,"After the success of minisode1, came a new chapter for the group being FREEZE. Of course, being TXT, they experiment with each comeback and this one makes you go, ""Like, oh my god, so holy."" The lead song, ""0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)"" is an emo rock style song with an anthemic and powerful instrumental. The amazing chorus and beat will definitely be one where you scream out the lyrics at the beginning of dusk, in the car (carefully, of course, safety is first), or vibing to it at 3 am to get in the feels. Just makes you wanna go like this. But don't be fooled by the melody, because the lyrics are truly on to break your heart. Being written and composed by Danke (lalala studio), “hitman” Bang, Melanie Joy Fontana, MOD SUN, RM, and Slow Rabbit (just to name a few), it is surely one of the group's best songs yet! The lyrics are emotional and romantic, centering on a person struggling for love. The strong concept and emotional lyrics are amplified by the hidden details in the music video. When it came out, you bet I was sobbing by the visuals of the music video and the lyrics. It made me fall in love with TXT all over again! Now then, better get back to something.......""ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ, ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ....""

—Hobschiske""술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride)"" - Brave GirlsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
While Brave Girls quickly reclaimed their title as Summer Queens with their hit single “Chi Mat Ba Ram” and viral sensation “Rollin’,” their best song came with the release of “술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride).” A sequel to their 2020 city pop single “We Ride,” the new song is a shimmering display of their talents. Featuring the girls' dreamy vocals and harmonies over a synth-wave beat. The song also infuses a little bit of rock which was quite trendy this year. The track draws upon all the new trends without overdoing them. The music video and the lyrics of the song compliment the sonic production of the song that describes the emotional journey following a breakup. The track finds the girls embodying their name. While they are heartbroken over a breakup, they end the song with the realization that they are brave enough to overcome the heartbreak. This realization is also represented in the music video, shown with member Yuna dancing in the rain being carefree, and Eunji burning the bouquet she held on to. ""술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride)"" not only showcases diversity in their discography but also maturity and reminds listeners that they are senior artists in the industry and not just a one-hit-wonder act.

—ssaa10dec""Alcohol-Free"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Ever since the release of ""Fancy"", TWICE keeps surprising us comeback after comeback by trying different sounds. After offering their own take on tropical house with ""More & More,"" exploring a more retro, Dua Lipa-esque vibe on ""I Can't Stop Me,"" and finally showing a darker side with ""Cry for Me,"" they are now back with a summer song that feels really unique, ""Alcohol-Free."" The unexpected association of bossa nova with hip-hop (!) works amazingly well and creates a refreshing atmosphere that I haven't experienced in other K-pop songs. The members' vocals particularly shine, with smooth vocalizations at the end of each sentence. Listening to the track takes me away from my daily life for a while and I find myself chilling on a sunbed with a cocktail in hand—whether a mojito, margarita or alcohol-free beverage—exactly what a good summer song is supposed to make you feel like, right?

—ab212""Boom"" - DPR LIVE ft. DPR IANOriginal Song
""Boom"" is a sexy song full of fun melodies and summer vibes. This track is my favorite from DPR LIVE's EP IITE COOL and it features DPR IAN, whose album I'm obsessed with (and in my opinion is AOTY). Having the two together again after ""No Blueberries"" was definitely a treat. They are absolute musical geniuses. During your first listen, you would never expect the alt-rock interlude with angsty and vulnerable lyrics. This builds all the way up to finally explode back into the main song like a true rollercoaster, leaving you with the same feeling of adrenaline when the ride is over.

—EleventhCassette""Butter"" - BTSOriginal Song
I was very excited and looked forward to ""Butter"" as soon as BTS announced its release.  And as I thought, they didn't disappoint me. It was a great song and I can't stop listening to it ever since.  For me, the best part of the song is the chorus & verse 3 (especially SUGA's rap part), I also love the instrumental part after the second chorus. RM's songwriting made the song feel even more personal. I believe this song has better proved BTS' success and it showed how perfect BTS are. The music video is a visual treat and all the members looked amazing. With ""Butter,"" BTS has once again given us fans a summer anthem to vibe all year long.

—a'A""Cloud"" - WavyCake ft. Donutman & ClavitaOriginal Song
A single that was included in his third full-length album BAGGAGE. At first, I didn't think the collaboration would happen, but I was sure it would be catchy since WavyCake, as well as Clavita—an uprising R&B singer with distinct sounds—are known for that. The chorus that was brought by Clavita is perfectly stuck in my head due to its witty lyrics, and Donutman made sure to enhance their chemistry.

—sa44""Drunk-Dazed"" - ENHYPENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of ENHYPEN; when Drunk-Dazed came out, I had already put the group off to the side, despite having watched the entirety of i-land. However, ""Drunk-Dazed's"" horror carnival concept really helped me hit the nail on defining what kind of a group ENHYPEN is; before, as a casual listener, I often felt as if ENHYPEN and other boy groups sometimes overlapped in sound and concept. ""Drunk-Dazed"" flowed very naturally and never lost the momentum gained by the bass starting in the first verse, despite the melodic verses, chorus, and bridge all sounding distinctively different. The chorus is simply phenomenal: the repetition of the lyrics conforms to the song's concept and makes you feel like you're stuck on a carnival ride, and the high pitched variations in the lyrics convey a wonderful anomaly to conformity, but never jarring nor frightening. The dynamic, yet sharp choreography of ""Drunk-Dazed"" takes the song one step further to showcase the ability of HYBE and ENHYPEN to seamlessly weave together the music and the arts.

Despite that the album is packed with high-quality music, this ballad is one of the best songs on off it. The song asks, 'What if the end of the world comes? What will be the most important then?' what hits harder in uncertain times we are living in now. The rough rap of the questions asked paired with GSoul's soothing vocals really hits differently, and makes it feel even nostalgic. But this song, contrary to appearances, is not sad, and the conclusion is that after all, you have to dream, love and live life to the fullest, as if there was no tomorrow, even if the world is dark and things seems out of control.

—siannve""Film out"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Not everyone knows, but BTS are masters in creating atmospheric soundtracks, and so it was this time. ""Film out"" is the fourth BTS' song made for the Japanese cinematography (after ""Don't Leave Me,"" ""Stay Gold,"" and ""Your Eyes Tell""), and acts as the main theme for the film Signal: Long-Term Unsolved Case Investigation Team. This moving ballad, co-written by Jung Kook, really shows off their vocal abilities and proves that they can sing and rap in any language—the harmonies, the flows, not a single one feeling out of place in the song. The song is filled with emotions and soulful vocals, and I'm sure it'll have a special place in many hearts. Despite being sung in Japanese, it has topped the charts in over 100 countries, including the world's biggest music markets, such as the US, Japan, and the UK.

—siannve""First"" - EVERGLOWOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
For girl groups with powerful concepts, EVERGLOW is a name that should come to mind. The sextet has explored many different genres, such as powerful military-style ""Adios"" and retro ""La Di Da."" With ""FIRST,"" EVERGLOW continues to prove they are aiming for the top, while also being the ""firsts"" exploring varieties of power concepts. ""FIRST"" is a powerful trap-EDM track that makes me feel like I'm about to face off against the final boss in a video game (which may as well be EVERGLOW). Even with a new concept, the song is still so EVERGLOW and it shows off the girls' talents quite well. Leader Sihyeon got a big share of the vocal parts, allowing her to show off her vocals alongside Mia. Onda, lacking recognition throughout their career, got the center position for the dance break. Aisha and Yiren made the stage theirs with their amazing charisma. And main rapper E:U, though short, had an extremely memorable rap part, adding the last bit of spice needed to make ""FIRST"" one of the most powerful songs of 2021.

—PlanNine""Gone"" - ROSÉOriginal Song
Rosé's vocals on the songs of BLACKPINK generally packs a punch and have a certain attitude to it. But, ever since hearing her part on the bridge of ""Lovesick Girls"", I was craving for the soulful and emotional side of it. And ""Gone"" delivered exactly that. When I first heard the teaser of the song, I was immediately in love with the melancholic and slow guitar strums, and the chorus was also already latched onto my mind. And when she performed the song on THE SHOW, it immediately solidified its position on my top favorite songs of all time. Every time I hear the song, a breeze of nostalgia sweeps over me. And despite the lyrics talking about hardships and pain, it gives me warm waves of comfort.

—Nosyneko""I Can't"" - CitiOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
You might have seen this artist posting covers of popular songs by your favorite artists. The R&B singer-songwriter Citi has been slowly gaining traction on social media for his mellow sound and soothing vocals. Released earlier this year, ""I Can't"" is a heartfelt R&B jam with a somber yet hopeful message. A track about not giving up on a loved one, ""I Can't"" is a slow-burning track that goes back to his simple songwriter roots carving an intimate space for him and his listeners. Citi's soft sound is paving him to be an artist to look out for in the upcoming year.

—ssaa10dec""LAST WALTZ"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Last Waltz"" had an interesting trajectory for me. This left me astonished on the first listen. That orchestral melody became one of the highlights, plus their exceptional vocals proved they could pull off a certain kind of style that TWICE rarely unveils. This is the kind of song I’ve always manifested for them to include again in their discography after “Cry For Me."" The song blossoms into a pleasurable track that brings a hailing shot of seductiveness. If I had it my way, I’d bump up the track’s beat and dance to it.
—Deign_Paul_Archie""Life Is Still Going On"" - NCT DREAMOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Seeing the reactions to the song online, “Life Is Still Going On” really captivates every listener’s heart. The grip that this song has on me makes me so happy, and because of that, I bop to it all the time. It’s a pretty, aural-leaning tempo track, that is made more engaging by its standout raps; the song succeeds on the strength of its groove. After a flimsy, languid verse, the track’s chorus sets its rhythm and is definitely a song to vibe to. I admire the variety of textures and structures used because the song gives a fun sense of interplay, made even more fitting with a fair dose of blessed ad-libs. The finished product feels like the soundtrack to a peaceful scene.

—Deign_Paul_Archie""LOTUS (H1GHR Remix)"" - Jay Park, JMIN, BIG Naughty, pH-1, TRADE L, Woodie Gochild, JAY B & PARK HYEON JINOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
H1GHR MUSIC's Jay Park, JMIN, BIG Naughty, pH-1, TRADE L, Woodie Gochild, JAY B, and Park Hyeon Jin teamed up and released a remix of FORCEPARKBOIS' ""LOTUS."" The original song was released by the Malaysian 15-member hip-hop collective in the February this year, and made a hit with millions views and streams both on YouTube and Spotify. The remix, released only on YouTube, doesn't go for a commercial success, but instead of that focus on showcasing exceptional hip-hop skills of artists involved, and on praising the South East Asian rap scene, what Jay Park accents in his verse. The song samples the original chorus and adds the unique verses from H1GHR's hip-hop and R&B artists, and while each of them has a distinct style, they all together sound smooth, and none of them disappoints. The Korean remix follows other all-stars rap remixes from across the region—""LOTUS (Singapore Remix)"" and ""LOTUS (Brunei Remix).""

—siannve""월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)"" - ONEUSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
With the widespread globalization of music, this year saw pop music continue to redefine itself, thanks to a slew of captivating fusion hits. Korean boy group ONEUS released one such track, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA).” A traditional Korean song infused with nu-disco and city-pop beats, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)” combines many different cultures, making for an infectious pop hit unlike any you’ve heard before. Written by the group’s members, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)” makes reference to the Queen of the Night, a rare species of cactus that blooms only at night and wilts before dawn. The Chinese phrase in the title can be translated to “beauty under the moon.” Together, the two titles exemplify the powerful sentiment explored throughout the song. The power of the song can be seen as it earned the group their first-ever music show win and lots of critical praise by music lovers across the globe.

—ssaa10dec""Magic Carpet Ride"" - NCT 127Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
R&B is a genre that NCT 127 has grown comfortable with since debut, but still, they are always able to be innovative with it. Dynamism, talent, and years-long expertise are shown through ""Magic Carpet Ride,"" a distinctive piece that features NCT 127's ability to tell a sweet love story chaperoned by their velvety, skilled vocals and low-paced rap. From the first listen, the audience can easily be swept away by the song's warm ambiance, which is enhanced by the emotions and devotion that emanates from each member as the bridge and last chorus arrives. The multilayered 2000s inspired sound is recognizable and provides an enjoyable atmosphere while NCT 127's main vocalists seamlessly help connect one verse to another. Among every R&B-based release of NCT 127, ""Magic Carpet Ride"" easily paves its way as one of the most memorable and special tracks, as the group's polished teamwork is effortlessly detected and admired.

—loveholic""MAVERICK"" - THE BOYZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Slowly but surely achieving international success, THE BOYZ had two well-received comebacks in 2021. While ""THRILL RIDE,"" the first, was a summery and vibey song, the more recent ""MAVERICK"" takes the cake as their most intense title track, sporting a darker concert than they have ever done before. The song's narrative centers around a maverick—someone who is independent and does not conform to societal standards—accompanied by a survival game concept that is reminiscent of Netflix hit 오징어 게임 (Squid Game), which blew up a month prior to the song's release. The music video portrays this concept well, with members in intense confrontations with one another, leaving us on edge to see where this plot will lead. Aside from standing out amongst the crowd, the song showcases the group's many strengths. The verse progression alternates between fierce rapping to strong vocals, eventually leading into an intense chorus with their signature synchronized choreography. Overall, this is one of THE BOYZ's strongest comebacks and is definitely a sign of success for them in 2022.

—PlanNine""Next Level"" - aespaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After already being heralded as ""monster rookies"" thanks to their November 2020 song ""Black Mamba,"" aespa truly shine on follow-up single ""Next Level,"" which reimagines A$ton Wyld’s 2019 song of the same name. While ""Black Mamba"" served as more of an intro to aespa’s half-digital concept, ""Next Level"" lets Giselle and Karina show off their rap skills while Ningning and Winter highlight their fluttering vocals, with different sections of the song taking inspiration from different genres. It’s proof that the success of ""Black Mamba"" was more than just beginner’s luck, and that aespa is here to stay as one of the most promising new girl groups.

—VinylZombie_MCR""Odd Eye"" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
In late January, DREAMCATCHER came back in full force with their title track ""Odd Eye"" from their EP Dystopia: Road To Utopia, the end of their 'Dystopia' trilogy. ""Odd Eye"" starts off with strong and mysterious melodies, the lyrics portraying how humans keep chasing a perfect world that doesn't exist—a Utopia. The pre-chorus builds the song up with haunting synth sounds until the chorus drops with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever. As a breaker, Dami's rap verse has a more electronic vibe, and my favorite lyrics in the song, ""Struggling with meaninglessness, we seemed to be in the same place again with endless thirst. No matter how you chase a mirage, it's not there."" In the bridge, I always imagine that's how DREAMCATCHER would sound like after a big explosion, a breaking point where they've realized their reality and lost all hope. I love the choreography at this part, leading to the girls' powerful spinning jump in the last chorus. Vocally, the highlights there are Yoohyeon's and Siyeons's harmonies and backing vocals, landing the song to a breathtaking end. Besides the musical aspect of the track, the music video for ""Odd Eye"" is the best film release of DREAMCATCHER so far. The girl group has always had great music video concepts, but now they've perfected them with amazing direction, special effects, artsy sets, and cyberpunk imagery. With the conclusion of the 'Dystopia' series, I can't wait to see what else DREAMCATCHER has in store for us.

—EleventhCassette""Paint Me Naked"" - TENOriginal Song
The perfect demonstration of Ten's attributes as an artist is conveyed through ""Paint Me Naked."" Not only is it bright, with its addictive beat and changing colors, but it also showcases Ten's creativity and devotion for his art, as he took part in the creative process of the release. As a fan of Ten, there is nothing more inspiring and awe-inducing than seeing him reinvent himself with every work of his, and it is easy to tell that he is always trying to challenge himself and go on new adventures. May it be either his spotless work ethic, the power that the pop-rock song oozes, or the facility with which Ten can belt out high notes and lighten up a gloomy mood through his charisma and dancing abilities, but ""Paint Me Naked"" is a delightful piece that brings out the best of Ten and showcases him as one of the most complete performers out there.

—loveholic""PTT (Paint The Town)"" - LOONAOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""PTT (Paint The Town)"" is probably the song that I was most excited about so far this year (alongside ""Like It Hot"" by GWSN). It was really exciting since member Haseul, who was put on hiatus for over a year, was returning. This was my first comeback with her and it definitely made me like the song more. The song features a catchy Bollywood instrumental and honestly was really different from what I expected. The bridge along with the pre-chorus were the best parts of the song in my opinion. I also adore the part that Go Won and Vivi share. There is also a Japanese version of the song, so if you enjoy listening to J-pop more, I would recommend that version. The chorus has an easy-to-listen beat drop which compliments the piece a lot. The lyrics to this song provide confidence as LOONA always has inspiring lyrics that will make you feel like a badass. ""PTT (Paint The Town)"" is a song that I'd recommend if you enjoy strong concepts.

—seokyoung""Ready to love"" - SEVENTEENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Thematically SEVENTEEN’s “Ready to love” was one of the most interesting takes on romantic love this year. “Ready to love” is as much a statement as it is an offer. The ‘me’ of the song is offering themselves and their love to the one they love. If this love will reach fulfillment is up to them. It is, as the album is aptly titled, “Your Choice”. This situation leads to a song filled with a nervous but hopeful energy, that is exemplified through the steady beat which pushes the song forward like a pulsating heart. Anxiety and anticipation swell, as more and more instruments, kick in towards the chorus, needing a release or catharsis. Additionally, the choreography is probably one of SEVENTEEN’s most elegant ones to date, reminiscent of “Fallin’ Flower” or “Don’t Wanna Cry” in its combination of difficult moves, flowing gestures, and narrative formations. It perfectly encapsulates the emotional vulnerability of putting yourself out there, unsure whether one will be accepted or rejected. The song doesn’t indicate what the choice is or ought to be. Instead, it leaves the listener on a reverberation that feels like an empty space, as one anxiously anticipates a response.

—sianii""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" - DKBOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Backed by strong synths that lay a nice foundation for DKB's powerful vocal and rap lines, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" was an interesting choice for a comeback single. Relying on lo-fi R&B beats, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" is quite different from typical boy group title tracks which is what makes it stand out in the crowd. The soothing track is perfect for looping during study sessions or being played on chill summer nights by the beach. The looping factor feeds into the song's theme which is about repetition and the cycle of pain in relationships. The music video accompanying the song is a visual masterpiece that captivates its viewers from the start. With a powerful and diverse discography under their belt, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" is a great addition to DKB's roster of songs.

—ssaa10dec""Spider"" - HOSHIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
It is kind of hard for me to believe that “Spider” is Hoshi’s first proper solo release. Hoshi’s command throughout the song and the track’s ability to lure in its listeners like a spider to its prey is one of the many reasons why I love the song. Weaved over a sultry electric guitar, “Spider” lets Hoshi shine not only as a performer but also as a vocalist. With 13 members in the group, Seventeen songs often struggle with the vocal part distribution. With a solo release, Hoshi is once again able to remind listeners of his talent as a singer. The music video and the song’s insane choreography are other highlights of this debut for me. From his forehead (God bless his stylist) to the upside-down acrobatics, the music video was filled with moments that fans can instantly fall in love with. With “Spider,” Hoshi proves why he was chosen as the performance leader in Seventeen and also makes his impact as a soloist with tremendous potential.

—ssaa10dec""색안경 (STEREOTYPE)"" - STAYCOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Riding the success of the ever-catchy ""ASAP"", ""색안경 (STEREOTYPE)"", STAYC's second comeback of the year, cemented the group's status as an up-and-coming 4th gen girl group, despite the small size of their company. Produced by HighUp CEO Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon, this future bass electronic-pop track was destined for success, and indeed delivered STAYC their first three music show wins as a group. The song's lyrics present a message about not wearing tinted glasses - not coming into a situation with predisposed stereotypes and thinking outside the box without judging people by their looks. In typical STAYC fashion, their outstanding vocals, particularly in ISA's bridge solo, also blew up on TikTok after the song's release, accelerating their rise to popularity even further. As a group that can't seem to make a bad song (though their debut track was ""SO BAD""😉), I cannot wait to see what STAYC has in store for us in the coming year.

—LukeNolastname""슈퍼 참치 (Super Tuna)"" - JinOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Released on the celebration of his 29th birthday, without any promotion, and with the performance video shot quickly at the theme park he was visited during his spare time, it was simply co-written, produced, and recorded spontaneously by Jin. All that because this upbeat one-minute trot song supposed to be ""just"" a small surprise-gift shared by Jin with the ARMYs (BTS' fans). Little did he know because this hilarious ode to his love for fishing is an instant bop and took the world by a storm. ""Super Tuna"" has been trending #1 on YouTube under the Music category for 16 days straight, what has never been done by any Korean soloist before. The song has also made its mark on Billboard Top 10 Hot Trending Songs. Moreover, it has inspired several memes, as well as a dance challenge, where people show their renditions of the 'super tuna dance' (which was choreographed by Jin himself)—from the TikTok celebs and Baby Shark creators to real tuna factory workers and the South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (currently, the #SuperTuna TikTok hashtag accumulated over 200 million views). The song made even unexpected waves like Korean news outlets covering serious reportage with the experts to break down the song, or leading to surge in sales of nautical dog toys. But despite all of these achievements, most of all, ""Super Tuna"" is a remarkable mood enhancer and reflects one of the lesser-known to general public but wonderful sides of Jin's character. Now there is nothing left but to wait for the second verse.

—siannve""The Dreaming"" - MONSTA XOriginal Song
The closing track from MONSTA X's second English language album, ""The Dreaming"" is one of the most beautiful tracks in the group's discography. With a somber tone, the track stands in contrast with most of the album. The track's bittersweet sentiment is one that resonates the most with listeners. ""The Dreaming"" brings out the sensitive side of MONSTA X while giving some food for thought, particularly for those with starry ambitions. The song encapsulates the group's journey quite well who have many 'trophies to show' for their achievements, but their real achievement is their growth over the past six years. The song features some of the group's best vocal performances which amplify the heartfelt message of the lyrics, especially the chorus which sings ""Is finding the gold worth losing the rainbow? / The colors are there / Are they the same though?""

—ssaa10dec""소리꾼 (Thunderous)"" - Stray KidsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
After a massively successful 2020, Stray Kids made their 2021 comeback a bang, proving once again they are K-Pop trendsetters. ""소리꾼 (Thunderous),"" is a high-energy hip-hop track, with stylish raps and a strong vocal buildup to a catchy hook and a danceable chorus drop. The song's concept and uniqueness comes from the wordplay of ""소리꾼"" which doubles as ""noise maker"" and a term for traditional Korean singers of 판소리 (pansori). In the song, Stray Kids dub themselves as the ""noise makers,"" going with the theme of their ""noisy"" album, NOEASY. They will not conform to a mold that is expected of them and will continue making their music (their noise). The song incorporates several elements of traditional Korean music in the song and the music video, with Changbin rapping in a 판소리 (pansori) flow and instruments including drums, cymbals, gongs, and other percussion and woodwind instruments. Stray Kids are always finding new ways to express themselves through their music, and the take they took this year is definitely one to remember.

—PlanNine""Vanilla"" - KAIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Following the song's name, KAI's honey voice shines on the mellow-sounding ""Vanilla,"" a melodiously intimate track that highlights the artist's best elements as a vocalist. The slow-paced yet sensual ambiance of the song draws the listener right in, with an ethereal, almost soothing feeling of being inside an idyll taking place. As KAI switches to a higher register, the emotions conveyed match the song's charming and well-thought-out lyricism. The track's repetitive hook is nothing but addicting, as the built-up adlibs and skillful falsetto soften it out and help build a solid piece that gracefully gains more likability the more you listen to it. Although Peaches is only KAI's second project as a soloist, ""Vanilla"" demonstrates the performer's vast experience within the music industry, as he confidently created a track that can go along with the album's dreamy concept but can also stand out on its own.

—loveholic""Zombie"" - PURPLE KISSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
From Dosie’s first “bie-bie-bie” there is no getting away from this infectious earworm. Purple Kiss’ first comeback after their debut in March of this year manifested them further as a promising artist to keep an eye on. “Zombie” is an electronic dance-pop track with a pushing beat and just the right amount of smart ideas to be interesting and clever instead of overladen. Like the little adlib at the end of the song’s intro or the electric guitar riff that bridges the gap between verses and chorus. A very charming idea was also the aegyo added to the line delivery of “아이 깜짝이야!” by Ireh and Jieun. This cute brightness is woven through the whole song and is one of the reasons that make it such a continuously pleasurable listen. Visually the juxtaposition of the rotting undead and the mood of the song is perfectly translated into a bright and colorful music video which includes neon green brains and a hungry mob chasing the members until nothing but Dosie’s skeleton remains. Very aptly called bubblegum horror by a friend of mine, “Zombie” is an all-around fun time that makes you want to listen to the song again and again or learn that cool zombie movie from the choreography.

And I just stood there, bathed in the quiet

No, you say you’ll cut your bangs, I’m calling your bluff
When you lie to me it’s in the small stuff
You say you’ll cut your bangs, I’m calling your bluff
When you lie to me it’s in the small stuff

Now the flesh is melting off of your bones
The maggots around your heart make themselves at home

Of a boy and his own tale of two cities

Sometimes a man breaks, sometimes he can't bend
When his youth is a wound time won't mend

Sometimes a man breaks, sometimes he can't bend
At the thought of peace as something only lent

And the bottle stain that just won't wash, that just won’t wash, wash away
A seed was planted in the sod of nothingness from which you came
And flowers grew and roses bloomed

672,Trains in the Distance at Night (1996),Collected Recordings 1994- 1999,Strictly Ballroom,Sad,"
1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY
The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over
scene, we SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976

2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY
A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the
edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind
her.

CINDY
-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just
agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of
freeing the hostages.
(adjusting her hair)
We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some
forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --
captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.

3. FERRYBOAT - DAY
The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --
has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,
who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via
walkie-talkie.
SWAT CAPTAIN
Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their
way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters
preparing for takeoff.

4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from
Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.
A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,
schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand
by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and
a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.

RINGLEADER
Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and
we blow her brains out.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
(filter; from walkie-talkie)
Blow whose brains out?

5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the
jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in
the whole of the statue's head.
RINGLEADER (O.S.)
(a nasty laugh)
Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!

6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY
MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.

SWAT COP
Sons of bitches.

SWAT CAPTAIN
Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out
first.

SWAT COP II
Captain . . . what the hell is that?

All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from
the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head
of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:

SWAT CAPTAIN
Shit.  Shit fire!!

SWAT COP
Sir!  What is it?
7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,
blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!

8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold
suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting
inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.

NIGHT OWL
Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?

He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,
blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:

VEIDT
(on monitor)
Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.

9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a
thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.

10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows
nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his
walkie-talkie:

RINGLEADER
Hey.  We got a problem here --

He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.

RINGLEADER
Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,
Goddammit !

11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT
The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,
he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy.

SWAT COP
Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!

SWAT COP II
What do we do now?

SWAT CAPTAIN
We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.

12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.
There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he
swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.

Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather
breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it
matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.

13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is
fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone
haywire.

TERRORIST I
Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in!
(flustered)
I can't get shit!

TERRORIST II
What the hell is going on??

There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --
just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.

Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to
his head.

TERRORIST I
I'M NOT JOKING!!

The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED
SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.

The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too
stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --

COMEDIAN
The joke's on you.

-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As
the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.

14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --

15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to
the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL
FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.

While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point
behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS
and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the
statue's upraised TORCH.

The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch.

RINGLEADER
I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.

16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.

RORSCHACH
Got your flashgun?

CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and
goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits
behind.

17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.
He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,
then strolls over and jimmies it open.

ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.
This one's a WOMAN.

SILK SPECTRE
About time.  It stinks down there.

COMEDIAN
B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.

As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched
wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME
underneath.

SILK SPECTRE
Why do I get all the glamour jobs?

COMEDIAN
A woman's work is never done.

18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY
The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,
CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their
guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a
TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.

RINGLEADER
I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.

He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.
All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the
floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.

All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.
He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.

19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER
An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed
from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at
his throat.

COMEDIAN
Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?

20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the
TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.
(standing; to the crowd)
Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.

He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the
torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.

21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER
A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH
secures it to the tip of the torch.

22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT
SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.

SILK SPECTRE
Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .

COMEDIAN
Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their
balls off.

They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead
landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist
hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the
landing.

23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER
Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with
UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the
COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:

COMEDIAN
Well.  They look distracted.
(turning to face her)
Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?

SILK SPECTRE
Eddie -- !

Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He
turns.

One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself
over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A
SWITCH on the housing.

A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.

COMEDIAN
SHIT!

He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to
blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An
empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.

SILK SPECTRE
What about the --

COMEDIAN
FUCK 'EM!

There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it
around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only
a second before following suit.

24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,
he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as
well.

25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.
He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.

NIGHT OWL
Adrian!

VEIDT
Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.

NIGHT OWL
Well, good God, we can't just --

VEIDT
Mission aborted, Daniel!

NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.

26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT
On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.

27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER
The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS
throwing off sparks against the cable.

28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands
pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and
RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off
the torch.

29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open, and the two of them dive through.

30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER
RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP
streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of Lady Liberty.

Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.

31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an
overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.

32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER
Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat
against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling
DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.

33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER
The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He
turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.

SWAT CAPTAIN
That's it.  I quit.

The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --

34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the
demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date.

Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.
MANHATTAN.

Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --
are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:

COMEDIAN
ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?

And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which

Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially

TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather

37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT
Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT
UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP
drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo
faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where
heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED
PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER

38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the
high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated
bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.

A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON
AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""

CUSTOMER
Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with.
(indicating the cop cars)
What happened over there?

NEWS VENDOR
Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.

39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from
the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.

PATROLMAN
STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!

We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of
reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the
city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:
his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears
a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance.

DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the
investigation.

BURNS
Had a lot of blood in him.

HYDE
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.

BURNS
No idea who's behind this?

HYDE
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.

BURNS
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a
call from Washington.

HYDE
Washington?

BURNS
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.

40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign,
a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.

The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,
cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in
response and plugs on.

At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET
CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate.

It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight.

The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above.

DISSOLVE TO:

41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted
corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door,
SEALED OFF.

42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are
flapping wildly.

A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.

SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps
inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room.

The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,
gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The
flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS
and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.

The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains
of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky
glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for
his face.

He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and
ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.

We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.

43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk
dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.
Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.
He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket.

44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,
and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.
RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits.

He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on
the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.
THUMP.

He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing
a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.

He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a
bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,
rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
PHOTOGRAPH.

RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's
costume.

They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.
METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH
himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we

DISSOLVE TO:

45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated
-- old before his time.

He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.

46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in
progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in
knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG
sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious
decision to move on.  Then --

VOICE
Hold up, papa-san!

The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and
spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they
march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,
almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we

CUT TO:

47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the
gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place
in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.

It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in
an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of
fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--

-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,
transporting us back to:

48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF
WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the
alley.

LOUDSPEAKER
HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --

The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the
LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids.

DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past
help.

49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's
apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.

DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs
it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for
the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most
peculiar sight:

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach.

50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is
the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of
baked beans.

DREIBERG
How did you get in here?

Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,
utterly emotionless whisper:

RORSCHACH
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

DREIBERG
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --
emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're
wanted on fourteen counts of murder.

RORSCHACH
At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.

He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it
to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Look familiar?

DREIBERG
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

RORSCHACH
Human bean juice.
(beat)
The Comedian is dead.

DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.
His jaw goes slack.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --
beautiful view.
Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.

DREIBERG
Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?

RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he
must've had enemies.

RORSCHACH
So do I.  So do you.

DREIBERG
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just
paranoia.

RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG
blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But
RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the
front door.

RORSCHACH
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with
a grudge.
(pause)
Thought you might want to spread the word.

DREIBERG
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He
opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.

RORSCHACH
You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.

He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo
from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.

DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,
CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple
tunic and mask . . .

51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is
far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome
desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is
ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's
DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and
pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.

VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic
patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his
office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the
like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE
RINGS.

VEIDT
Veidt here.

52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT
DREIBERG
Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.
I had to call you before he --

VEIDT
Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?

DREIBERG
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.

VEIDT
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?

DREIBERG
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's
. . . I don't know, stalking us.

VEIDT
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red
fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a
chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders
DREIBERG's words.

VEIDT (cont.)
Daniel, Rorschach is insane.

DREIBERG
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells
blood.

VEIDT
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs
-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.

DREIBERG
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at
this late date.

VEIDT
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected
you.  Haven't I?
(slight pause)
Do you need money?

DREIBERG
No.  I just wanted you to --

VEIDT
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good
night.

DREIBERG
Good night.

VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a
cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of
the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a
long, slow drag.

CUT TO:

53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the
checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE
rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign
which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""

54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED
ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door
with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a
six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .

. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple
doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and
wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.

The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned
woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK
SPECTRE.

LAURIE
Adrian.

VEIDT
Laurie!  Good to see you.

She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall
in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.

LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized
machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific
paraphernalia of every description.

VEIDT (cont.)
Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?

LAURIE
Don't rub it in.  I live here.

VEIDT
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?

LAURIE
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.

She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT
wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A
SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:

VEIDT
Hi, Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
(a deep, booming voice)
Hello, Adrian.

DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under
any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.
Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a
calibration atop his particle accelerator.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
I think I'm about to detect a gluino.

In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just
about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the
physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of
time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.

Any government would be glad to have him.

VEIDT
Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann
caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .

LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.

LAURIE
Please, you guys, no shop talk.
(to DR. MANHATTAN)
Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?

DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable
six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist
-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:

LAURIE (cont.)
Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?

He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.

VEIDT
. . . Are we being monitored?

DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the
little red ""ON"" lights wink out.

DR. MANHATTAN
The bearer of bad news.

VEIDT
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.

LAURIE
Blake?  Dead?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the
funeral as a matter of protocol.

LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first
she's heard about it.

VEIDT
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to
think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.

DR. MANHATTAN
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.

VEIDT
What's your theory?

DR. MANHATTAN
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern
me.

VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is
considerably less amused.

LAURIE
I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?

VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another
part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as
we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side.

A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of
the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in
midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.

VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat:

VEIDT
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.

DR. MANHATTAN
You mean Afghanistan?
(beat)
It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more
interesting.

The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The
cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws
itself shut.

VEIDT
Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as
usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,
Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds
his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.

LAURIE
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --

VEIDT
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.

LAURIE
Please.

There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his
shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing
with his superaccelerator.

VEIDT
He's a little farther gone every time.

LAURIE
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to
someone human.
(beat)
He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I
mean -- he even scares the research teams.

VEIDT
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed
the world.

LAURIE
(embarrassed)
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's
doing his work --

VEIDT
What about you?

LAURIE
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.
(pause)
I'll ring for the guards.

She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,
concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case:

VEIDT
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.
(handing her a cigarette)
Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give
Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

LAURIE
Maybe I'll do that.

VEIDT
I'm sorry about Blake.

He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS
appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.

LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and
WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.

CUT TO:

55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,
popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level.

56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT
The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS
hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS
stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and
grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.

Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE
off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the
bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing
glasses.

RORSCHACH
Harry.

HARRY
(petrified)
R-Rorschach.

RORSCHACH
Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?

He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH
picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.

He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:

RORSCHACH
Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had
help.
(wandering through the room)
Thought maybe you could fill me in.

ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as
RORSCHACH strolls past.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?
(moving on)
Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?

Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?

NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH
extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --

-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He
closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and
SNAPS IT.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Edward Blake.  Who killed him?

No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH
grabs his index finger and repeats the process.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Who killed Edward Blake?

NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to
the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let
fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.

VOICE
JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!

RORSCHACH
THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?

By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.
Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It
catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of
glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the
ceiling.

SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He
looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
So many vermin . . . so little time.

He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it
contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long
enough to HISS at the crowd:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be
around.


CUT TO:

57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN
The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller
research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and
LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over
to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is
empty.

LAURIE
(muttering; groggy)
Jon . . . ?

A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE
closes her eyes and sighs.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm here, Laurie.

LAURIE
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?

DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet, there's plenty of time.

A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.
DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.

LAURIE
Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?

The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,
toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.

DR. MANHATTAN
Would you like me to stay?

LAURIE
Mm hmm.

DR. MANHATTAN
I could stay and go.

LAURIE
. . . And just how would you manage that?

She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its
downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is
massaging LAURIE's thigh.

Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly
wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.

DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the
foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.

LAURIE
AAAAAAAAAA!!

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie?  Are you --

DR. MANHATTAN II
Don't be upset.

This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's
fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown.

LAURIE
Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one
person again, please?

The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --

DR. MANHATTAN II
-- you would find it erotic.

LAURIE
All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy
in this place, I --

While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance
through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,
she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through
the door . . .

58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER
. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:

LAURIE
You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your
stupid experiments --

DR. MANHATTAN III
Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.

LAURIE
So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how
could you do this?

DR. MANHATTAN III
You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?
(pause)
I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.

LAURIE
That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you
can --

She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered
the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:

DR. MANHATTANS I & II
Laurie, please --

LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back
slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.

LAURIE
Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I
could really use the time alone.

She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &
II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original
DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his
equipment.

FADE THROUGH TO:

1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard
at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly
beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely
wasted on her preoccupied date.

At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:

LAURIE
The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I
guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.
(mock-macho)
I have to keep him in line.

She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to
laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room.

LAURIE (cont.)
Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?

DREIBERG
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think
anyone's out to get us -- do you?

LAURIE
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no
Mother Teresa.

DREIBERG
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

LAURIE
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the
government or do time.

DREIBERG
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty
tricks -- political assassinations --

Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then
leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:

LAURIE
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us
made other choices.

DREIBERG
(shaking his head in disgust)

Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors
. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.

LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?

LAURIE
I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now.
(raising her glass)
Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .
and we're not.

DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.

1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,
which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters
of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.

DREIBERG
The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I
mean, we were heroes!

LAURIE
Damn straight.

DREIBERG
Damn straight!  We were heroes.

LAURIE
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

DREIBERG
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the
world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .

LAURIE
(smiling)
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?
What was his name . . .

DREIBERG
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd
beat him up?

LAURIE
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?

DREIBERG
(deadpan)
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an
elevator shaft.

LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to
her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA
PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a
stentorian VOICE over scene:

CHAPLAIN (V.O.)
In the midst of life we are in death . . .

CUT TO:

59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY
AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.

CHAPLAIN
. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall
change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --

TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of
mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the
attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons
of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off
with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.

CHAPLAIN (cont.)
-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things unto himself.

A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.
MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish
miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the
distance, and he glances off at:

60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT
SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the
cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has
been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like
wildfire.

MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due
respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:
gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd.

A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to
join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the
VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.

It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled
marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,
and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,
Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze
plaque bears the inscription:

IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM

Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four
hundred of them.

61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet
home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her
through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind
her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.

62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT
LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,
fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the
card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.

She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls
up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps
out.

LAURIE
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.

ADAMSON
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

LAURIE
Why?  What's the problem?

ADAMSON
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.

LAURIE
(chuckling)
I would like to use the bathroom --

As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.

ADAMSON
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

LAURIE
What?!

ADAMSON
Please.

The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The
GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.

ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.

The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging
from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION
SUITS.

63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to
a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard
at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white
gown:

NURSE
Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.

LAURIE
What -- ?

DOCTOR
Drink this.

The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She
stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.

DOCTOR
Drink it.

64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT
TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are
shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of
a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens
on:

65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A
donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,
foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to
the anteroom.

Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head
wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right
as she wonders just what the hell is going on.

66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.

LAURIE (O.S.)
That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.

LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table
surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent
SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken
from a thick sheaf.

LAURIE (cont.)
Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The
quantum-whatever.

SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the
Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE
hesitates.

LAURIE (cont.)
That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.
(long pause)
Rorschach . . .

SCHMIDT
Their real names, please.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names.

SCHMIDT
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names!

SCHMIDT
You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on
the answers you give.
(holding up the sheaf of photos)
These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --

LAURIE
Then why don't you ask him?!?

Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced
torturers, they understand the value of patience.

LAURIE (cont.)
I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.

One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out
for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door
opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.

He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and
tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with
curiosity:

LAURIE (cont.)
Someone had better tell me what's going on here!

SCHMIDT
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file
are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else
in common as well.
(beat)
They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.

LAURIE
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?

All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes
bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she
takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.

SCHMIDT
I'm terribly sorry.

LAURIE
What does this mean?  What does it --

SCHMIDT
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can
see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

LAURIE
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible
joke to make me --

She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to
his comrades, and heads for the door.

SCHMIDT
Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a
call.

The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches
for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,
she buries her face in her hands.

67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a
two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been
watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.

ADAMSON
Poor kid.

SCHMIDT
We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.

ADAMSON
To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc
Manhattan.

SCHMIDT
What do you mean?

ADAMSON
She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows
which way he'll jump.

DISSOLVE TO:

68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing
a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern.

The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal
gold stripes.

Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration.

It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the
mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.

69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY
TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green
room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.

DIRECTOR
We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is
that big blue son of a --

He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just
rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's
face.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Am I late?

DIRECTOR
No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm
Kent Turner, the director. . .

The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a
hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.

LIAISON
Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to
steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll
just play it cool --

DIRECTOR
Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give
us something a little darker . . . ?

DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.

DR. MANHATTAN
Will this do?

DIRECTOR
Perfect.

LIAISON
Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --

But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by
a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are
hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON
hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC
underneath.

70. INSERT - TV MONITOR
Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for
their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right
and takes in an extraordinary sight.

A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through
the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the
greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts
of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation
crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:
""VIETNAM.  1965.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific
mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been
the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --

We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad
thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds
a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.

His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey
gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM
hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met
with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:
""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a
one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding
the Communist menace in check.

DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from
American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake
hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a
three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic
accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia,
there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""

71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop
of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded
news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:

BRINKLEY
For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by
correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,
I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.
(turning)
Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better
known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.

Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at
BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.

BRINKLEY (cont.)
I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,
where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now
since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .
. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that
you intervene?

DR. MANHATTAN
I will not intervene in Afghanistan.

A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.

72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.

73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.
BRINKLEY ignores them:

BRINKLEY
You're saying you would refuse a direct request?

DR. MANHATTAN
There will be no request.  I will not intervene.

BRINKLEY
Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can
actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?

74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on
DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE
in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:

LIAISON
I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.

75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
DR. MANHATTAN
I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.
(long pause)
I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will
not intervene.

He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.

BRINKLEY
Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll
open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?

REPORTER
Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read
you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.
Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?

DR. MANHATTAN
All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.

ROTH
Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.
Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all
been diagnosed with terminal cancer?

The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He
gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face
an unreadable mask.

76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone

LIAISON
Oh Jesus.
(barking into phone)
I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I
have to!

77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN
ROTH
I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly
diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a
connection?

By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make
himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message
from the booth, touches his headset and announces:

BRINKLEY
I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief
message --

Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,
flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.

LIAISON
THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!

The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,
PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB
THE SET.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause
cancer??

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't wish to answer any questions.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
You see the future!  Did you know in advance --

LIAISON
The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP
ASIDE!!

The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this
information --

DR. MANHATTAN
Please get out of my way.

The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.
SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN
lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!

In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no
microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.
MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.

BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,
there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,
leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.

CUT TO:

78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is
overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post
quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised
when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
Where's Laurie?

ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and
he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely
necessary.

ADAMSON
She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .

DR. MANHATTAN
There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the
results positive?

ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.

He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His
mind is already a million miles away.

ADAMSON
Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .
could you cure her?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know.  I only know that I won't.
(long pause)
There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.

ADAMSON
""Begun?""  What's begun?

DR. MANHATTAN
I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.
(pause)
You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I
cared for . . .

ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down
his spine nonetheless.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.

And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves
behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at
the Major's feet.

ADAMSON
Good Lord --

CUT TO:

79. EXT. OUTER SPACE
-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few
hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily
apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily
beautiful
-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white
clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing
our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.

It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on
nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.
Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to
leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.

80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT
Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so
barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,
until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined
quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,
half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than
husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a
rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.

A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden
RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue
light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth.

The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long
mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.

A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We
MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and

DISSOLVE TO:

81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY
It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN
-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:

JANEY SLATER (O.S.)
Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger.

JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten
with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple
of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just
close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's
probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush
JON has on her.

JON
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.

JANEY
With lots of ketchup?

Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries.

JON
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

JANEY
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug
like you doing in a place like this?

JON
Anything for science, I guess.
(long, hesitant pause)
Janey, there's something --

JANEY
(simultaneously)
We should get back --
(realizing she's cut him off)
What?

JON
Nothing.  What were you going to say?

JANEY
We should get back to the lab.
(staring at him; chuckling)
You okay, Jon?

He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he
pipes up:

JON
Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.

The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads
for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after
JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.

His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up
behind her.

JANEY
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --

JON
(blurting it out)
Janey, will you marry me?

She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict.

JANEY
Jon -- what?

JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes
locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the
canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the
door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and
one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled
JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.

There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private
trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.

WALLY
Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.

JANEY
Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --

JON
I can fix it.

JANEY
-- What?

JON
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better
than ever.

He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.

WALLY
Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.

Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY
hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her
with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his
answer.

But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.
He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --

JON
Here.  I'll trade you.

-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.
With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but
he's already gone.

She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.

82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY
JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S
TOOLS.

It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap.

With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,
remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed
with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST
CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of
it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like
anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.

He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and
walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK
from the direction of the test chamber.

Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,
seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON
eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber.

Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it
hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the
concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.

JON
C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .

The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in
hand.

JON (cont.)
. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.

He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch
inside.

He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.
Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the
doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete
block, reaches for the watch --

-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.

White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.

Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --
TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.

He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps
sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams
shut.

83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One
of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of
MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities.

SCIENTIST
-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell.

GENERAL
(joking, but worried)
No danger of . . . fallout, is there?

SCIENTIST
No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why
we waited outside.

The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red.

The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant
THUMPING.

The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect
unison.

GENERAL
What's the matter?

SCIENTIST
Sweet Jesus -- !

We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the
terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,
screaming soundlessly.

Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,
punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization:

GENERAL
Say, there's a man in there!!

The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One
SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --

SCIENTIST I
Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!

-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:

SCIENTIST II
Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.
chamber!!

The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.

GENERAL
Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??

SCIENTIST III
It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence
starts.
(to SCIENTIST II)
What's the word?

SCIENTIST II
(covering the phone)
They're sending a crew to the generator building --

SCIENTIST IV
TWENTY SECONDS!

In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN
CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the
canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the
glass, and grabs the ax.

SCIENTIST I
Wally!  What are you doing?

WALLY
The power cables!!

And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY
SLATER.

JANEY
Am I late for the --

She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back
through the door.

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!

But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.

JANEY
What in the name of -- where's Jon?

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Please!  Go!!

WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall.

Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white
light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look
at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.

JANEY
Jon.

84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his
face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,
which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .
. .

. . . and everything in the room goes blue.

85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT
The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to
tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind
them.

JANEY
Jon . . .
(shrieking)
JON!!!

86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of
unbelievable agony.

A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a
photographic negative -- stands in his place.

Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to
pieces.

And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,
and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,
who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.

DISSOLVE TO:

87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago
at 11:48 PM.

For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches
the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen.

88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.

89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into
the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal
cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous
system.

They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light.

90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A
partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS
for several seconds before vanishing altogether.

92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.

JANEY
I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it
feels haunted.

WALLY
It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.
(tugging at his ear)
Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?

Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.
Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.
Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon.

UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without
warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW
suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .

. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,
nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.

JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.

JANEY
JON-N-N-N!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,
stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig.

A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,
tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and
Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new
engagement ring.

His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.

95. SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:

-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;

-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue
light;

-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.
There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .

-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.

96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN
Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at
first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground.

97. EXT. OUTER SPACE
All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth
at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on
toward Mars.

The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.
Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:
vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.
Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre
planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular
ridge.

Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a
happy-face.

Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian
atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we

CUT TO:

98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.
As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on
his angered face:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said leave me alone!!

Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same
positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on
the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.

PULL BACK TO:

99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT
A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.
She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the
big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy
furnished studio.

TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported
a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania
Avenue!

TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --

LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,
SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.

SCHMIDT
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.

LAURIE
Am I free to go?

SCHMIDT
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move
it.

LAURIE
(fed up; exploding)
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit
--

SCHMIDT
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan
border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living
soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic
weapons has finally flipped out.

LAURIE
Jon??  You mean he's --

SCHMIDT
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard
has apparently left the planet.

CUT TO:

100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY
The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:

DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH
Russian Tanks Advance
President Vows ""Maximum Force""
WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?

And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS
VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:

NEWS VENDOR
I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,
bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a
bitch --

CUSTOMER
Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?

NEWS VENDOR
Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!

VOICE
New Frontiersman, please.

The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old
friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.
He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under
the counter.

NEWS VENDOR
Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.
(beat)
Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.

The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED
PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!""

STREET CRAZY

101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A
DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight
WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and
off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging
tipsy giggles.

102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN
ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;
his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --
we'll call him MOLOCH.

MOLOCH
Now.  What was milady drinking?

LUCY
Gin.  Straight up --
(mock-ladylike)

-- with a little twist of lime.

She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest
joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:

MOLOCH
I think I can oblige.

103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The
contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen
floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a
disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in
the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.

LUCY
Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?

On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.
He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen
table.

RORSCHACH
Moloch.  Did you miss me?

LUCY
Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?

RORSCHACH
(glancing up)
Who's the welfare mother?

MOLOCH
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong
guy.

RORSCHACH
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.

MOLOCH
You're making a big --

RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against
the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.

RORSCHACH
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.

MOLOCH
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

LUCY
Willie, what's he talking about?

RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.
RORSCHACH kneels beside him.

MOLOCH
Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for
ten years.  I --

RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him
close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:

RORSCHACH
Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.
(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)
Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.

He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar
bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as
MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's
behind it?

MOLOCH
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with
--

RORSCHACH
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

MOLOCH
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

RORSCHACH
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as
RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when
he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.

-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously
at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking
about.

104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY
The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a
big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world
looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a
MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight
POINTER,
highlighting areas of strategic importance.

ANALYST
Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there
it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.

GENERAL
Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're
quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.

MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which
bears the seal of the President of the United States.

PRESIDENT
First strike.
(long pause)
I'd like to view the simulation.

The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.

ANALYST
Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of
their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.

On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the
Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --
blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION
SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.

PRESIDENT
What about our end?

ANALYST
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that
twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.

ANALYST (cont.)
Britain down -- Germany down --

PRESIDENT
What kind of time frame are we talking about?

ANALYST
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified
command bunker at the time of the launch order.

RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

PRESIDENT
. . . Of course.

By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a
dedicated optimist, turns to announce:

ANALYST
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the
farm belt.

PRESIDENT
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter""
theory?

ANALYST
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .
may depend on a quirk of the weather.

PRESIDENT
The weather.  I see.
(pause)
Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum
strike conditions.

The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:

SECRETARY LIDDY
Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan
may decide to return.

With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the
table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined
and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than
that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at
74.

PRESIDENT (cont.)
Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of
retirement.

105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an
examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the
doorway.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.

LAURIE
Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.

106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK
A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near
the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken
tandoori.

DREIBERG
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a
couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .
(pause)
How about you, Laurie?

LAURIE
(lying -- with forced cheer)
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the
hell out.
(shrugging)
No expense account.  No place to live.

DREIBERG
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each
other, someone might put two and two together . . .

LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.

LAURIE
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're
right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the
Watchmen.

DREIBERG
Maybe not, but why take chances?

LAURIE
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent
all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --
I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own
life, and --

-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a
damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts
to get up.

LAURIE
I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find
myself a cheap room.

DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the
door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and
chases her down:

DREIBERG
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .
.
LAURIE
Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

DREIBERG
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely
right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

LAURIE
You're sure?

He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the
restaurant.

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the
street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of
frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of
ketchup.

He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down
question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he
opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.

107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET
A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,
then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls
casually down the alleyway.

He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the
crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a
small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a
shifting INKBLOT MASK.

108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:
flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.
It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as
DREIBERG ushers her in.

LAURIE
This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.

DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands
there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.

LAURIE (cont.)
Are you . . . waiting for a tip?

DREIBERG
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I
mean, if you need some aspirin, or --

LAURIE
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really
sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?

She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her
unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.

109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG
As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE
unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door
shut.

110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds
his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.

111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --
LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off
valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.

An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into
frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP
overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and
snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.

His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom
adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of
LAURIE.

113. EXT. STREET - DAY
Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in
an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and
crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.

MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA
DINER.

114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and
pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the
nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges
of his EYELIDS.

His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;
bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it
up . . .

There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.

A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and
sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.

He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and
holds the stall door shut.

RORSCHACH
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational
drugs.

MOLOCH
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got
something for you.

A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.

MOLOCH (cont.)
There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on
a case, trying to track 'em down.
(beat)
It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all
I've been able to find out.

RORSCHACH
Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.
(snarling)
Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.

With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits
there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't
open.

MOLOCH
HEY!!

RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the
adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we

115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY
A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's
decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in
an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the
process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure
who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.

JUSTINE
Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.
Are you the world's smartest man?

VEIDT
Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.

A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!

JUSTINE
You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty
basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday
lives.
(pause)
If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?

VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls
out his gold cigarette case.

VEIDT
Sphinx brand.
(opening the case)
When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .
humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good
in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,
that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs
as you smoke it?
(lighting up)
In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?

JUSTINE
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your
old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

VEIDT
(bristling)
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the
Watchmen.

JUSTINE
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.

VEIDT
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --

VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.
He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.

VEIDT (cont.)
-- we agreed specifically --

MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting
curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.

VEIDT (cont.)
Excuse me a second.

He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley
JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.

116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY
VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with
his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:

VEIDT
KITTY!!

One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --
no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his
dignity.

VEIDT (cont.)
How the hell did you get in here?

The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He
looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass
window.

RORSCHACH
New information.

VEIDT
(pointing to the telephone)
Ever see one of these before?

RORSCHACH
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked
up.

VEIDT
What is that ungodly smell?

RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark
HISS.

RORSCHACH
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .

VEIDT
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a
roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.
(beat)
And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us
all look bad.

RORSCHACH
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad
press.

He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.

CUT TO:

117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a
broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and
cursing.

LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full
glass of wine and thrusts it at him.

LAURIE
Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately.
(smiling)
I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.

Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think
of you as Dr. Manhattan's --

He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.

LAURIE
His what?

DREIBERG
His . . . whatever.

LAURIE
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?

She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward
the dining room.

LAURIE
Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any
more difficult than we have to, huh?

The latest bad news from half a world away:

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the fighting continues to escalate . . .

On a televised MAP of Afghanistan, RED RUSSIAN ARROWS are working
their way slowly but inexorably toward Pakistani territory.

the US to intervene.  President Nixon has placed America's European

119. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty
dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in
dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball
game.

LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much
interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo
cabinet.

LAURIE
That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.
(smiling)
God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.

She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it
are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's
items.

DREIBERG
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I
listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

LAURIE
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.
(flipping through records)
Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these
people.

DREIBERG
Play one.  Educate yourself.

LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar
COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.

LAURIE
Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.

TV CHORUS
""Oh my darling, it's incredible,
That someone so unforgettable . . .""

120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as
RORSCHACH lets himself in.

TV CHORUS
"". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.""

RORSCHACH
Moloch?

No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,
seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance
around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,
the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her
face:

TV ANNOUNCER
The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and
wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming
NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses
the aging process . . .

RORSCHACH
Moloch?

He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.

121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH
staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND
BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and
spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --

TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
For the smooth young face he'll never forget --

122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the
TV ad.

TV ANNOUNCER
-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.

DREIBERG
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?

LAURIE
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm
thirty-eight years old!

DREIBERG
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide
it?

LAURIE
I like the way you look.
(beat)
It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.
But you, Daniel, you look . . .

DREIBERG
Old?

LAURIE
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.
(standing up)
Here, you pick one.

DREIBERG
. . . What?

LAURIE
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,
with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.

123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:

LOUDSPEAKER
RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO
COME OUT.

He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street
outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A
CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.

LOUDSPEAKER
YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!

He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES
-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.

124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller
tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt
pocket.

Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making
him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her
hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so
that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth.

The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:

""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .
Do you think that you could love me too . . .""

125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --
ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around
under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,
rubbing alcohol, Drano.

Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the
burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .
Would it impress you . . .""

126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.

""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""

127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --
resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the
front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room.

The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --
creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF
BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""

128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in
disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,
unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going
well.

""S'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""

He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her
breast.

129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through
the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.

He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he
ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.

130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from
the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov
cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.

The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit
the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.

RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is
coming up with back way behind him.

131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.

132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE
hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .
Would it impress you? . . .""

133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it
anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she
doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,
embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.

"". . . Or would it distress you?""

134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.
By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU
COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.

He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for
his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,
where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""

The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He
steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their
weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.

The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.

135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the
face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a
blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN
FIRE peppers the roof.

""S'posin' I declare it.
Would you take my love and share it? . . .""

RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front
of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on
the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and
tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed
AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.

""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""

The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL
OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street
below.

136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and
lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on
him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts.

COPS
GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!

RORSCHACH
GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!

In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face
topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar
face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world.

COP
Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears
elevator shoes!

RORSCHACH
NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!

He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van.

COP II
So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.

RORSCHACH
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!

The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.

CUT TO:

137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He
stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.

DREIBERG
I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --

LAURIE
It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold
me.

For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His
gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.

LAURIE
Daniel.  What --

On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL
reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.

TV ANCHOR
. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked
vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent
confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .

The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.

LAURIE
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

DREIBERG
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get
to trial.

Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and
the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.

TV ANCHOR
. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a
history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described
Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:

LANDLORD (ON TV)
All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that
place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --

LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low
whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to
pace the room.

LAURIE
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.
(beat)
I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?
What's wrong?

DREIBERG
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?

138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING
The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID
-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement
nearby, reading a comic book.

The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic
little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""

NEWS VENDOR
Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for
that.

KID
No way.  This one sucks.

A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the
newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.

DR. LONG
Gazette, please.

The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover
bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,
with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""

NEWS VENDOR
'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!
(shaking his head)
I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You
never know.

LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he
wanders off down the street.

139. STUDY - NIGHT
DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk
with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of
RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the
NYPD:

NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph
ADDRESS: Transient
BORN: 3/21/43
MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)
FATHER'S NAME: Unknown

By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,
wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When
she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his
seat.

DR. LONG
Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.

SYLVIA
How much longer?
(staring down at the desk)
It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --

DR. LONG
Rorschach
(correcting himself)
Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.
We pulled his record from the juvenile home --

Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's
direction.

DR. LONG (cont.)
No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child
abuse . . .
(swiveling to face her)
Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,
these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out
just what makes them do it.

SYLVIA
Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.

SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS
FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.
They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and
crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY
DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""

It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a
shiver.

SYLVIA (cont.)
Why don't you come to bed?

DR. LONG
(totally engrossed)
I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive
material.
(grabbing a transcript)

Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one
word of comment: ""Good.""

SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,
and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG
goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.

DR. LONG (cont.)
Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an
extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.
(nodding his head)
I can reach him.

CUT TO:

140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in
folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor
reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.

DR. LONG
Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look
at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All
right?

RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up
the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.

RORSCHACH
Butterfly.

LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Some nice flowers.

LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third
card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.

He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of
frustration.

DR. LONG
Walter --

RORSCHACH
Don't call me that.

DR. LONG
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to
hear.

RORSCHACH
Wrong answers?

DR. LONG
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest
response, I can't help you.
(pause)
I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.

RORSCHACH
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.

LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.
He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under
the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.

DR. LONG
Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide
to cooperate.

TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to
leave.  He pauses in the doorway.

RORSCHACH
Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what
makes me sick.
(beat)
You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.

CUT TO:

141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY
A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,
fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.
JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the
central escalator and swing into action.

JUSTINE
Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?

He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and
secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the
cameras.

VEIDT
No comment.

JUSTINE
Did you know he was back on the streets?

VEIDT
I did not.  Now get out of my way!

JUSTINE
Isn't it true that you --

He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he
STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a
pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.

ASSASSIN
VEIDT!

VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and
comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's
agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY
in his hands.

He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a
FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.

As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and
slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King
Tut.

VEIDT
Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?

Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's
hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.

SECURITY GUARD
Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!

VEIDT
He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you
scum, I want to know who sent you!

The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down
into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.

VEIDT
Goddammit . . .

SECURITY GUARD
Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?

VEIDT
I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.

CUT TO:

142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK
TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.

NEWSCASTER
-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating
fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside
St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from
morning Mass --

A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,
reaches for the receiver.

DREIBERG
Yeah.
(beat)
Adrian!  What's up?

143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG
VEIDT
In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it
on the news.
(beat)
Someone tried to kill me today.

For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether
surprised.

DREIBERG
Who?

VEIDT
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm
starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?

DREIBERG
She's with me.

VEIDT
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.
(beat)
Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until
all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

DREIBERG
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.
LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off
her hair.

LAURIE
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?

DREIBERG
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.
(beat)
. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks
up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away
from him and steadies herself against a bureau.

DREIBERG
-- What is it.

LAURIE
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't
around.

DREIBERG
Laurie --

LAURIE
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --

DREIBERG
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,
fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over
behind her.

LAURIE
I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told
you --

But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from
behind.

DREIBERG
Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than
anything else in the world.

CUT TO:

144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving
area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward
the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby
tables:

VOICE
Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --

VOICE II
Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --

Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH
picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The
smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.

GOON I
Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.

GOON II
Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.

RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A
SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.

GOON III
I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .
.

GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.

GOON III (cont.)
Notched up some big names over the years.

Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of
his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III
follows.

The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving
counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings
a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and
tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,
into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.

Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH
uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON
II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby
burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with
HOT COOKING FAT.

All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two
disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked
and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in
with billy clubs drawn.

As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It
sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.

CUT TO:

145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT
A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --
delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of
the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are
totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal
doors.

At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,
then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of
RORSCHACH.

TRUSTY
Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'
man.
(beat)
Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .
this whole place blows.

RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The
TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.

TRUSTY (cont.)
I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --

RORSCHACH
I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.

With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.

CUT TO:

146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a
square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED
WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.

Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across
the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of
inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the
subject has decided to cooperate:

RORSCHACH
A whore fucking.

DR. LONG
Who is she?  Do you know her?

Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice
flowers"":

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.

LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --
(pause; then, smiling)
-- with his skull split open.

DR. LONG
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?

RORSCHACH
Why, doctor.  I did.
(beat)
He was a bad dog.

RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass
tacks.

DR. LONG
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In
your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?

RORSCHACH
God isn't there to do it.

DR. LONG
We don't know that.

RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.

DR. LONG
So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?
(no response)
You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why
would you want to kill a dog?

With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:

RORSCHACH
One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.

147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for
the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues
OVER SCENE:

RORSCHACH (V.O.)
'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no
word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to
intervene.

The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up
his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a
ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.

He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO
HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen
object.

148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,
flicks on a flashlight.

Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The
light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders
over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and
on the floor, a ROPE.

There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,
sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a
charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with
balloons and teddy bears.

He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden
CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding
paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's
knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh
WINDOW.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had
gone.

149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the
dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB
OF BONE.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Decided to wait for the owner . . .

150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN
enters and whistles to the dogs.

FAT MAN
Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--

RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.

151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the
story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his
reply, asks:

DR. LONG
Then what happened?

RORSCHACH
. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had
to break in.

152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's
handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a
GROCERY SACK.

He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack.

FAT MAN
What -- what are you d--

RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER
into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he
spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,
throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's
done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER
BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.

FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,
and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs
inside.

Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.

153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things
up.

RORSCHACH
When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their
skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.
(leaning forward)
See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed
her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,
he did't seem to mind.

DR. LONG
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --

RORSCHACH
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make
it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.
(slight smile)
What else can I illuminate?

LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he
points a finger at LONG's inkblot.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .
just a man's face.
(pause)
See it now?

The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a
second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he
STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.

LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the
Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.

DISSOLVE TO:

154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK
A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to
the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.

After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.

LAURIE
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

DREIBERG
Memory lane.

He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.

155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER
Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.

LAURIE
Daniel . . .

DREIBERG
Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.

She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull
it back to reveal . . .

THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit
tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.
DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around
to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.

LAURIE
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.

DREIBERG
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,
reliving days gone by.

LAURIE
Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?

DREIBERG
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some
cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.

LAURIE
Antarctica??

DREIBERG
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come
along.
(pause)
I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a
bad place to sit out a war.

LAURIE
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be
left.

DREIBERG
You and me.

He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her
gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly
rejected.

DREIBERG
. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there
anyway.

Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just
opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES
-- their old superhero togs.

LAURIE
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.

DREIBERG
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.
(chuckling)
The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping
people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't
know.  It all seems so abstract.

LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink.

LAURIE
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.

DREIBERG
What are you up to?

LAURIE
Don't look.  Turn around.

Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the
cabin.

DREIBERG
This'd better not be what I think it is.

LAURIE
Okay!

DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite
imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns
shock:

DREIBERG (cont.)
My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender
of the weak!

LAURIE
In the flesh.

She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,
and strokes his thinning hair.

LAURIE (cont.)
Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.

DREIBERG
Saving the world?  I guess I do.
(smiling)
Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .

DISSOLVE TO:

157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK
A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned
out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met
by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous
BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks, they're all frightened as hell.

Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.
The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to
happen.

MAN ON STAGE
You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're
sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --
a first strike!

VOICE IN CROWD
You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?

MAN ON STAGE
Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But
we can't stop it!!

VOICE IN CROWD II
It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!

VOICE IN CROWD III
Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!

VOICE IN CROWD IV
It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!

A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:

HECKLER
Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us
no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!

MAN ON STAGE
You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the
end of the world!!

The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the
stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start
swinging rifle butts.

As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of
HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials
""CTU""

158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.

CTU CAPTAIN
I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.

159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their
midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.

LOUDSPEAKER
CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.

A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,
turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling
rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.

CUT TO:

160. INT. BARN - DUSK
DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,
wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:

DREIBERG
Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?

No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.

161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her
face is distraught, agonized.

LAURIE
Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.

Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the
CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs
below.

DREIBERG
What the hell -- ?

LAURIE
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

DREIBERG
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.

He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.

LAURIE
They're just mowing 'em down.
(pause)
This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we

CUT TO:

162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>
We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE
OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,
like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws
closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out
NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.

There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless
motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as
the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --

-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE
TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the
action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in
full-color and real-time --

163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the
Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.
Seaport!

164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.

DREIBERG
Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.

On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.

165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT
A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.

CTU RADAR MAN
Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .

The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --

166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT
-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured
ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets
sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against
the water.

167. ANGLE ON CROWD
pointing at the skies in disbelief.

VOICE IN CROWD
LOOK!  UP THERE!

VOICE IN CROWD II
Oh my God, it's --


168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG
He barks into a microphone:

DREIBERG
Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --

169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the
OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!

CTU LOUDSPEAKER
UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.

The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But
a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the
strange sight overhead.

VOICE IN CROWD
. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!

EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,
clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West
showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into position.

170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.

DREIBERG
We're gonna have to shave this one close.

An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle
FULL-FORWARD.

171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS
CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond
before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES
FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD
CHEERS.

172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship.

LAURIE
They're following us.

DREIBERG
All right.  Mission accomplished.

He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the
ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.

173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU
SHIPS rip past on either side.

174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT
ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The
OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE
blows a HOLE in its facade.

175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.

176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar
readout:

LAURIE
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!

DREIBERG
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.

LAURIE
(checking the monitor)
They're practically on us . . .

DREIBERG
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""

177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP
The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving
the CTU craft in the dust.

178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,
and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.

A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The
less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and
EXPLODES

The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last
moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP
ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles
for the airborne route.

179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER
The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the
cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.

There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges
UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS
against the roof of the tunnel.

180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.

DREIBERG
Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.

181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an
almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its
wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --
but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water.

182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.

LAURIE
We lost him.

He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.

LAURIE (cont.)
Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.

FADE THROUGH TO:

183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of
him.

TRUSTY
Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.

The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes
through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,
it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named
T-BONE.

CON IN LINE
Otis went down.

T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of
SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:
LITTLE BIGGER.

T-BONE
Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.

LITTLE BIGGER
Fuckin' Rorschach.
(nodding to himself)
This joint goes up.  Tonight.

184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight.

185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is
singing ""You're My Thrill.""

Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the
controls.

The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it
right.

It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.
The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the
cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.

LAURIE
Better.  Much better.

DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile
instead.

LAURIE (cont.)
I bet I know what made the difference this time.

DREIBERG
What?

LAURIE
(smirking)
The costumes.  Am I right?

DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite
himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.

LAURIE (cont.)
Come on.  Admit it!

DREIBERG
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.

LAURIE
Yes you are.

DREIBERG
(drily)
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.
(pause; then, seriously)
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.

LAURIE
That's because --

DREIBERG
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's
about to end.
(a weird smile)
I feel like I could save it.

He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship
hard right.

LAURIE
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?

DREIBERG
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .
(turning to face her)
I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.

LAURIE
. . . What??

DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches
for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.

186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through
the clouds above the city.

CUT TO:

187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON
-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:
disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,
throwing food.

188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls:

DREIBERG
I think we're just a trifle late.

LAURIE
Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below
them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.

DREIBERG
I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen
times.

189. INT. CELL - NIGHT
SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs
drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.

190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT
Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past
sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR
MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the
psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,
and T-BONE.

Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop
outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.

LITTLE BIGGER
Find an outlet for this thing
(shouting)
Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!

RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying
a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's
door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.

CARLOS
See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .
and pickle 'em!!
(chortling)
Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!

HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door:

T-BONE
Lemme see.  Lemme see!

LITTLE BIGGER
Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.
(to T-BONE)
What's he doin' now?

No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel.

LITTLE BIGGER (cont.)
You deaf?  I said, what's he --

He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over
backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON
quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket.

RAFE
BOSS!  JESUS!

LITTLE BIGGER
Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE
A GRAPE.
(to RAFE)
Light the torch.

RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
RORSCHACH's cage.

191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the
inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.

CUT TO:

192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic
EARMUFFS.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof
running . . .

He throws a switch on the control panel.

193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH
splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop
their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as
the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .

194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT
The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S
FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his
TOILET.

Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its
mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is
FLOODED.

195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER
RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.

RAFE
Okay, boss, that oughta do it.

They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER
come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.

LITTLE BIGGER
WHAT THE --

RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but
there's no trace of RORSCHACH.

CARLOS
Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .

RAFE
Where is the fuckin' runt?

CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his
fist.

196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.
He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of
the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .

. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,
monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide
and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.

CARLOS
YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --

From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor
BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --

-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --

-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do
a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --

-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock
DIM and DIE.

LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down
off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead.

RORSCHACH
Your move . . . runt.

The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.

197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to
get their bearings.

LAURIE
Where are we?  What happened to the lights?

DREIBERG
Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .
. .

Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND
CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a
SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.

DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a
familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach??

RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half -- then keeps on walking.

198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He
throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.
Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.

RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,
LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor.

LAURIE
Rorschach!  Is that you??

He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and
dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand
at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.

LAURIE
What's he doing?

DREIBERG
I think he's going to the john.

LAURIE
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and
he stops to take a --

Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a
paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a
""howdy.""

DREIBERG
. . . That was quick.

RORSCHACH
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.
(beat)
Let's get out of here.

CUT TO:

199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.

Air Force One is coming in for a landing.

200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER
Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling
about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.

SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and
what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal
ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an
imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating
a long stay.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?

SECRETARY LIDDY
She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right
away.

LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless
corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.

SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)
Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour
window.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Fourteen hours, huh?

SECRETARY LIDDY
Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.

CUT TO:

201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen
. . .

NEWSCASTER
-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place
the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --

. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control
console, occupied by other matters.

DREIBERG
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his
mangy cat on me.

DREIBERG
What new information?

RORSCHACH
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan
somehow involved . . .
(scratching his chin)

Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.

There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,
highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.

DREIBERG
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.

LAURIE
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at
the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the
screen:

NEWSCASTER
. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was
unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the
Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.

RORSCHACH
""Ozone layer""?

DREIBERG
(rolling his eyes)
Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??

CUT TO:

202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of
pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous
strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered
around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is
one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.

203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT
The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian
style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad
figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered
LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.
One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a
silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back
of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.

LACKEY
Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.

VEIDT
Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.

They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him
to:

204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT
The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated
REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,
RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.

VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal
a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,
picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more
informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,
a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in
and his eyes begin to rove.

205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL
PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,
sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON.""
VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense
logo . . .

BBC NEWSCASTER
-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as
possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter
can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --

FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to
the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:

NEWSCASTER
-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have
already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen
insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing
negotiations --

FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the
bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic
retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new
angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are
clear.  FLICK --

-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're
watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from
twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas
canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to
propose.

206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT
eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.

CUT TO:

207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.
On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.

208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,
gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,
POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.

DREIBERG
They've got my building surrounded.
(looking up at her)
They must've been following you all along.

She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.

DREIBERG (cont.)
So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.

LAURIE
Welcome back, Night Owl.

DREIBERG
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

RORSCHACH
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.

DREIBERG
What do you mean, frame-up?

RORSCHACH
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --

DREIBERG
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to
get back at us?
(spreading his hands)
What about all those poor shits with cancer?

TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting
distress.

RORSCHACH
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive
propaganda scheme . . .

DREIBERG
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

LAURIE
(interrupting him)
It's not.

RORSCHACH
Not what?

LAURIE
Not ""propaganda.""
(pause; then, blurting it out --)
Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.

DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face
bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her
grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say.

Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the
silence.

RORSCHACH
Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.

209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily
at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers
above.

210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.

LAURIE
I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between
us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --

DREIBERG
It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.

He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up
with tears.

LAURIE
I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get
myself together, okay?

211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.
RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees
DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.

Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.

212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.

LAURIE
Jon.  What are you doing here?

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.

LAURIE
Collect me?

DR. MANHATTAN
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.
You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

LAURIE
Jon, no -- I can't --

DR. MANHATTAN
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us
can do anything to change it.

DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.
MANHATTAN's hand.

DREIBERG
LAURIE!  DON'T --

Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and
LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.

Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can
do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.

RORSCHACH
Where's Laurie?

DREIBERG
I don't think she's coming with us.

DISSOLVE TO:

213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT
A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian
surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later
LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,
then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red
sands.

DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a
problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at
the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back
and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by
a HALO OF OXYGEN.

DR. MANHATTAN
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

LAURIE
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she
stops in her tracks.

Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a
PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren
sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and
pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle.

DR. MANHATTAN
I live here now.

He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after
him.

CUT TO:

214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the
glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.

RORSCHACH
Heading south.  What's the plan?

DREIBERG
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're
hightailing it down to Adrian's.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --

DREIBERG
(exploding)
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to
end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't
matter.

RORSCHACH
Coward.  Giving up.

DREIBERG
SHUT UP, Rorschach.

RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.

RORSCHACH
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.
(pause)
Sorry about Laurie.

DREIBERG
(choked voice)
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well
enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.

CUT TO:

215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING
-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.

LAURIE
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me
you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

LAURIE
You -- you know about me and Dan?

He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.

DR. MANHATTAN
Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.

LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.

LAURIE
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?
(flustered)
Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks
at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of
atoms.

DR. MANHATTAN
(startled)
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?

LAURIE
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

DR. MANHATTAN
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even
my responses.
(nodding)
We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --
Thirty seconds.

She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles
below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent
WIND whips across their faces.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe.
(staring out at the landscape)
Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?

She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and
fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and
frightened.

LAURIE
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me
once?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.

LAURIE
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be
being with me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't
know what did.

LAURIE
But you knew that I'd -- die.

DR. MANHATTAN
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .
(pause)
You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.

LAURIE
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've
always known.

DR. MANHATTAN
(nodding)
Always.  Ever since the day I died.

He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in
her hands.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me
these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be
destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless
agent of its destruction?

LAURIE
(sobbing)
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!

DR. MANHATTAN
Because --

LAURIE
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.
(angrily)
Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six
hundred years.

That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders:

LAURIE
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to
die I want to be with -- other people.

DR. MANHATTAN
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a
universe to explore.  I'll be alone.
(reaching for her hand)
You're the last human being I'll ever see.

216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south
Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and
begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .

217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.
Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad
tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:

RORSCHACH
What happened?

DREIBERG
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some
kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

RORSCHACH
What caused it?

DREIBERG
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --
(apprehensively)
-- outside of a nuclear blast.

DISSOLVE TO:

218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT
VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible
through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.

219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.

A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.

220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.

221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.

DREIBERG
I¹m taking her down.
(frantically throwing switches)
Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --

The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.

222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.

A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.

223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.

As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.

224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:

VOICE
Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.

DREIBERG
Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.

Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!

He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.

RORSCHACH
. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.

225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.

The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.

226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT
DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.

DREIBERG
Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.

RORSCHACH
Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.

RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.

227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT
VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.

TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.

VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX
growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's
neck: quiet, girl.

RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN
FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening
scene.  Suddenly . . .

RORSCHACH
VEIDT!

VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;
it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG
backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward
him, TEETH BARED.

VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a
futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --
part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?

RORSCHACH
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --

VEIDT
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of
course . . .

DREIBERG
The missing scientists.

VEIDT
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked
at Gila Flats.

RORSCHACH
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .

VEIDT
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save
the world.

228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.
RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping
at his heels.

VEIDT
Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers
-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.
(tapping his chest)
It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill
him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" --
that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting
rid of Dr. Manhattan.

DREIBERG
What??

VEIDT
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

RORSCHACH
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.

VEIDT
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.
(smiling)
He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a
little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates
cancer.

DREIBERG
Laurie?  You're responsible for --

VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box.

VEIDT (cont.)
One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate
than it is to cure.

DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the
stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and
LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.

VEIDT
Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you
without a moment's thought.

They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200
SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them
inside.

RORSCHACH
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

VEIDT
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking
at.

229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand
corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila
Flats, reassembling a WATCH.

DREIBERG
What is this?  It looks like Jon.

VEIDT
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.
Manhattan.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?

VEIDT
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.

CUT TO:

230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,
LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's
hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On
Mars.

DR. MANHATTAN
I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a
mystery I'd like to penetrate.

LAURIE
Jon, I do not want to hear it.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

LAURIE
(shaking her head)
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.

DR. MANHATTAN
You're the only human being I care for.

LAURIE
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter
a bit.
(pause)
I want you to cure me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I won't do that.

LAURIE
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.

DR. MANHATTAN
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.

LAURIE
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you
-- then do it.

Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her
chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.

Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.
MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the
hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .

A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN
INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian
landscape altogether.

With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see
the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great
white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the
Martian desert gradually materialize around them.

The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.

LAURIE
What -- am I --

DR. MANHATTAN
Cured, yes.

Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a
handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart
attack.

LAURIE
Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?

When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with
DREAD.

DR. MANHATTAN
Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on
me.  -- I can't remember the future.

Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around
him.

LAURIE
Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.

CUT TO:

231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT
VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.
room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.

Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON
OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into
its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future.

VEIDT
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.
(pause)
Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.

DREIBERG
What is it?  How does it work?

VEIDT
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time.
(smiling)
There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing
parallel to our own --

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you've lost it.

VEIDT
(pointing at the tachyon bubble)
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
(pause)

In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it
survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.

He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.

VEIDT (cont.)
The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.
(wild-eyed)
Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!

232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT
DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.

LAURIE
We¹re too late.

DR. MANHATTAN
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .

LAURIE
Jon -- what??

DR. MANHATTAN
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.

233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.

VEIDT
At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.

He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.

VEIDT
It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.
(turning to face them)
In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.

DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.

RORSCHACH
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

VEIDT
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?

DREIBERG
And what if you¹re wrong?

VEIDT
I¹m not.

DREIBERG
What if you¹re wrong??

VEIDT
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!
(shouting)
I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.

LAURIE
Jon, where are we?

DR. MANHATTAN
Veidt¹s complex.

235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT

Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:

VEIDT
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years
chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .
as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.

DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist
bullshit is going to save the world?

VEIDT
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.

He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.
Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.

236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS
In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .

237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up
--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the
trigger . . .

. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .

. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with
LAURIE at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?

VEIDT
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees
himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of
the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's
surprised.

In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to
sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN
THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.

VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He
shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and
points his STUN GUN directly at her --

-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.

VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --

VEIDT
NO!!!!

-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.

DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.

LAURIE
What was he doing?

DREIBERG
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --

DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
He was right.

RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.

DR. MANHATTAN
He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.

DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.

LAURIE
Jon --

DR. MANHATTAN
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.

LAURIE
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

DR. MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the
room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished . . .

The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to
happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time.

He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND
STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.

238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter
bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.

DR. MANHATTAN
Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.

A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps
forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.

For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame
surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.
MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the
chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across
the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he
spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding
FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging
with nothingness . . .

. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's
alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.

239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER
The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation
panel.

SCIENTIST
What in the name of God . . .

The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,
sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As
she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he
looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .

JON
Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --

SCIENTIST II
LOOK!!

The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .
. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular
RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are
three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and
RORSCHACH.

240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the
astounded SCIENTISTS.

LAURIE
What happened -- ?

DREIBERG
He saved himself.  He changed the past.

LAURIE
Where did he go?

Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to
THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For
a moment everything's back to normal --

-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.

A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around
them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into . . .

241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT
DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this
would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they
know it, they find themselves deposited --

242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them
materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,
slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the
same, knocking over a fire hydrant.

LAURIE
Dan, is this -- is this New York??

DREIBERG
Those cars.  What year is this??

LAURIE
Everything's changed --

It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's
our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,
the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of
whack . . .

RORSCHACH
Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.

BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of
course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden
presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:
Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?

RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too
close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to
several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection
altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill WHISTLE.

DREIBERG
Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!

243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT
The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our
world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT
TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR
is gapin at the ruckus on the street.

NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.

His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to
the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.

KID
Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!

NEWS VENDOR
What are you talkin' about?

KID
Superheroes!  Check it out!

He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" --
then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the
street.

KID
All right!  They must be on a case.

244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed
with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order.

COP I
Break it up!  Stand back!

COP II
Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --

DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.
They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant
to advance.

LAURIE
Dan -- what do we do now?

DREIBERG
(panicked)
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --

LAURIE
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't
they -- ?

RORSCHACH
They'd better.

And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and

FADE OUT.

677,No Has Never Had Three Letters,A Collection of Songs,Kodan Armada,Sad,"
The male stereotype isn't all it's cracked up to be. I refuse to live that lie. Ridiculed because of those not like me. I am not the same, I am not the same. I'll strive to make things better. I have to help you be safe again

I'll pick up the pieces to make you feel whole again

DAN: *Dear sister, I'm sorry, so fucking sorry. Dear sister, I'm sorry, so fucking sorry. I should have been there. I'm so sorry, and I will try to piece you back together. It's going to be okay, we are going to be okay. Let's just keep saying that. I will be there for you. Again and again
(*These are not the lyrics on the record, but the ones I say now.)

CORY: Unable to sleep at night, wondering if it will happen again. Maybe, maybe just lost. Will these arms be able to keep them away? Someday. Someday, someday you'll feel pretty. Life is a constant battle with myself. Ridiculed because of those like me. I am not the same, I am not the same. Society's cursed me with a standard. Take back the pieces, make me whole again

ADAM: It never ends, this brutal cycle. Please take her tears away, please make her whole againYou might also likeEmbed"
678,Postlapsaria,Collected,Saetia,Sad,"Reason defines us, beauty carries us, recognition makes us
Every thread well placed, every aperture leaks
Dream of the coming on, fail to realize
We cannot carry that which we cannot acquire
Oh we have lost what we longed for
The feeling in my arms, my embrace
That which you have dropped
This canon is complete
We need this

Touch me deeply as you once had
And I will not soon forget it
We speak in riddles to deny the past
To love the present, to prepare the future
Beyond that which we have more of
I have seen an old glimmer
It's starry eyes for empty skies, I tell you
I shudder so hard to find
An embrace so hard to maintain
I sweat pictures, words
Hours of days gone
Once buried
And the corpses now warm to the touch (to the touch)
(warm) (to the touch)
You might also likeI am the horizon
I have dreamt of my eyes tracing rings around this world
My arms are stretched to forever
My fingers shake with the fear of control
The fear I know you all know so well
We all lay claim to our destinies yet we all rise and fall with the current.[X2]Embed"
