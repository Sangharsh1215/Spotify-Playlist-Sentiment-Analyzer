For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)
[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Pre-Chorus]
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I'm cheap, still hit a chick like, ""Yo, can I borrow your Netflix?""

Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic

Təzdən sport Bentley aldım sonra Cayenne'nin içinə tullandım
Qancığı qoydum Bentley'in önünə, şoferin tam yanına
Ala, sən bu otu Rolls Royce'da çəkə bilməzsən
Cüt köpük stəkan hələ də əlimdədir, içirəm, boşaldıram təkərlərə
Tək başıma sport maşındayam
5 yaşım olanda qapını təpikləmək məcburiyyətində qaldım
Köhnələri rəfdə saxlıyıram, 16 mərminin hamsı alov kimidir
Ciddən bezdim bu yalandan tətiyi çəkirmiş kimi davranan və osdurağa basan bu oğlanlardan
Bezdim tərzlərini mənim dostlarımdan alıb özləri yaradıbmış kimi davranmaqlarından

Cartier sevgisidir bu, Cartier qəhbəsi
Yandan baxanda buynuza oxşuyan Cartier eynəkləri
Şahzadə kimi almazlar, Cartier olanından, həri
Cartier qəhbəsinə Cartier çanta
Wrangler sport maşını radara düşüb 200'lə
Cartier cinslər, əynimdən düşmür
Bu piyasada yıxılmağımın mümkünatı yoxdu
Yıxıla bilmərəm, oyundan çıxa bilmərəm
Ovucuma aldım arvadvın götünü və qapıya tərəf keçirdim
Çempion kimi otururam və vəd ediləni gözləyirəm
Təzə Chanel Patek'i özüm tənzimlədim
Yeni saatımla gəlirəm və heç qapını qırmıram
Yuxarı mərtəbəni çevirdim fahişəxanaya

Zaman dilimini xatırladım sizə, 2012'dən bu yana La Flame partladır
Masamda 100 milyon amma hələ də iş qərarları verməyə davam edirəm
Evimin qabağında yolda duran maşınlarımla bank hesabımdakı milyonlar arasındakı əlaqəni düşün
Mən tək başıma 4 qapılıdayam amma bil ki bayırda 100 dənə oğlan var
Ölümünə yanımdadılar, əmin ol
Gözəl illər keçirmişəm, yorulmaq mümkün deyil
İçimdən gələnləri eləməliyəm
Hər gün Super Bowl’du mənçün, sikim içini, yaxşı sən canı
Çox yük götürdüm çiynimə
Meydandayam, Odell kimi Richard Mille qolumdadı
Qız atdı əlini donuma bananımı ovuclamaq üçün
Geri gəlib dostlarımla əlaqəyə çıxmağım lazım oldu, 13 və 0 tərzində
Balama dedim ki, ""qızım, bu remix deyil, bu Sicko’nun bir hissəsidir""
Yox, biz eyni həyatı sürmürük, eyni işləri etmirik, eyni deyilik
Ana, mən uça bilirəm, problemlərim oldu amma hamsını çıxardım səmaya
Gətirdim mələkləri, bilirəm şeytan yoxlayacaq şansını
Çox isti oldu bura, elə bil bunu Paris Hilton dedi
Biz gələndə ziyan veririk, bu bizdən aslı deyil
Afterparty, Astroworld çıxdı piyasaya

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)

The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits

Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""

Across the universe and all the other galaxies

Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
[Chorus]

He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man, he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Everybody ride her, just like a bus route

You got no doubts (You got no doubts)
But we all see (We all see)
You got your head in the clouds

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me (Cooler than me)
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me1Embed"

All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tеars, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who's on the same pagе
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor
I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze

Lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fucking car
Speeding down the highway sippin'

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it
You might also like[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom
[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's
[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something

Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining

Taking trips to the fucking islands

Don't talk, do a nigga do or die

Gotta run up them Ricky Racks (yep)
In the safe in the real, we got hella plaques (yep)
Got more plaques on my wall than your brother teeth (facts)
Boy, you young, where your Similac?
Buyin' whips, yeah, we into that (yep)
Fuckin' hoes, yeah, we into that (yep)
Loving hoes, yeah, no nigga
Got a .223 inside the Hellcat (doot-doot)
Keep it all in the pack, huh
Hundred niggas in your section
Hmm, where the hoes? Nigga, that's weird (pussy, pussy)
Cop a new Lamb, cop a new 'Rari
Just to go and switch gears (skrt)
Burn out, burn out
Every time we turn out, make a big scene (yeah)
2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, spent it on my new jeans (skrt skrt skrt)
Gave big bro twenty-seven racks for his birthday, the world made a scene (facts)
Y'all don't even know how a nigga live
Spend twenty racks like two bands (facts)
Uh, came with the sticks like they hunting nigga
Throwing gang signs, call it taunting nigga
Can't nobody at QC get punked, nigga
What is a one-on-one, nigga? We jumpin' niggas
We got the strap, nigga, fuck it, we stompin' niggas
I'm just as rich as your favorite rapper, nigga, might be richer (yeah)
Hit the pent like I'm Derek Fisher
Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her
Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew)
Ha, real player like my pops (pops)
Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot)
We run it, not opps (ha)
Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times""
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like ""MA, where the album at?""
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2""
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are"", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like ""God damn, man, who is he?""
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
""Who Run It"" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Sleepin on rap niggas like its hopscotch
Got yo bitch bowin' down like its crockpot
Niggas goin down fast like stop drop
Run Shit
No pass, I can't drop
Niggas switch in my lane but I can't stop
Trash talk on your bitch like a raindrop
Then drop her ass off at the train stop

Pop a pill on the plane, i'm blind

[Verse 23: TA Double Dolla]
They say I'm bougie and cocky
I say I'm just getting started
Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her ""bitch I do it better"" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping
...
Pulled up with a bitch so thick I'ma leave a little bit early just to hit

Serotonin too lit

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom ""I don't do that!""
But she was really there
And I told her that ""Yeah, I'm coming in,""
But she was like, ""Nah, don't come near""
And I was like, ""GED""
And I said, ""I flip that, really get that""
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

[Verse 35: Futuristic]

[Verse 36: BlocBoy JB]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss

Smoking strong, that Hercules, you can't tell me shit
Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out
Started by pulling them tracks out
This shit is facts now, you can get whacked now
Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
East side, east side, east side nigga that's C side
Who up on my side nigga, you know I'ma ride
If you play with my side, bitch it's homicide
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 37: Key Glock]
I got gold gold on my throat, diamonds in my teeth (ice)
Clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, all this ice on me (ice)
Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah
I'm fly like a butterfly and I sting like a bee, yeah
Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

[Verse 38: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?""
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

[Verse 39: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg ""What's the wiz-zard?""
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 41: Moneybagg Yo]
Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I""m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first one a' y'all step...

Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fucking job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)

[Verse 3: Rocky Badd]
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

Yeah, I put my life on the line, man
See I gotta die man, don't you even try, man
Enemies gon' bleed, once I let these bullets fly, man
Mama's gonna cry, man, I like to get motherfuckin' high
Man, you're not the guy, man

Shout my nigga Greatness Dex, that's my fucking right hand
Thousand diamonds in my mouth, I'm the fucking Iceman
And you know I came in with the shhh!

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again

Now I'm comin' home again

Feel it comin' in the air (Yeah)
Hear the screams from everywhere (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the thrill (I'm ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (What's up? Come on)
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (What's up?)
Only thing that's on my mind (What's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Ah, what's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Yeah, what's up? Yeah)
We gon' run this town

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair (Yeah)
I break the rules, so I don't care (Uh-huh)
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain (What's up?)
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now (What's up?)
Only thing that's on my mind (What's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Uh, yeah)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (What's up?)
Who's gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the god
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin', ""Fuck the other side! They jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Who's gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West, Jay-Z]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel (What’s up?)

Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that
[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Sneaking through frontiers and borders
Like a guerrilla barefooted
Pure from the 50 cent sneakas into the breath
Of Hamas and Fatah hustling'
Like you got dat date flow
And watch' it bounce back to the booth
Onto to ya' booth and put a
Pause on ya twitchy feelin'
Bout dem missiles

Awakin' the firing' of the sleep-in
Yo ho flow
Droppin' presents from the sky, ho-ho
Makin' you looking'

A card to yo hand, as yo eyes
Make connection

Sir, yo surprise Ram, Allah n' Jesus
All got the same business card
The card flows n' bouncin' like

Through the dead sea through
Mogdishy n' back in to yo mug
Into yo stomach

Stored in yo mind

While you looking'
At the clock on the call
Reflectin' light, dreamas' all bittersweet
Fo a shear Shia like Azadari
The Sangre shimmers enrich
Yo taughts like watching' d
Iraqi rapper Lowkey, blow up

The fragments reload into a magazine
In the clock slinger on yo flavors
Like Flavor Flav
Shinin' light then fade to a lyrical sniper
The rebirth of nation like Public Enemy

Close yo eyes bismillah
Of the spring
Breathe in from the sky
Jam the Roff overseers
Then freeze from yo eyes
Then warm up to yo eyes like
The Palestinian in dat Birthday party

Waterin' yo flow
Lubricatin' yo mental gats
Like Graphite doesn't
Matter how yo seed or tree charged
Don't matter if you ever been ironized
Makin' it spray on the wall like 2Pac's Heart

Heard, my flow like a Keinan
Travel the world
My flow  a travelin' man
Threw the Mos Def
Alarm Clock Music fo'Dilated Peoples
Life's shabby, i'm of safety
She got a magnetic pussy
Is like she forcing' me to
Fuck her up

Dam, I try to stop
But I can't
Its a war some relationship'
Dam well call me K'Naan
Dam its like the elites
Fuckin her up trying'
To give her AIDS

I tried to ditch her couple of times
But didn't have the heart 2
Feel bad, cause imma always have 2 women
But can't loose thos one
When Imma finally get rid of her
Imma smile
Cause I knew the kids he made
Called struggle matured me up
2 pimp Azadi

I internalize 'em now
A mental nursery rhume
While I shared it rhyme minin'
Through my unearthed history
Watch the heavens carefully
Like E.T hunters and
My struggle meet yours in the
Nurseries in the urns

Remember the odes that
I 2 owed to Azadi 2 die
I was on the Route
Couldn't reach it in the physical like Fatima
Thas' why I release the
Odes into the waves
Hoping the urn gets to yo earsEmbed"

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walkin' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settlin' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin' that this song's comin' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin'; you start crying
I come over; I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losin'
I'm a ghost, and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place, 'cause

[Verse 2]
It's late-night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I'm chillin' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin' from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' 'em if she'd wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of 'em you
I miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking's
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall, and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm goin' straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J. and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money; then you burn me (Bernie), then you made off (Madoff)
She ain't a killer, but she'd fuckin' blow your head off
I know he wonderin', ""What the fuck you hidin'?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden; ayo, fuck this
Are we datin'? Are we fuckin'?
Are we best friends? Are we somethin'
In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

But not really

I don't party, but I heard Cardi there, so fuck it, I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life would've been if I never did take them risks and would have I prospered?

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

[Verse 2: Eminem & Bebe Rexha]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped-up feelin' and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

Let bygones be bygones and you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and

I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

Und Lil Jon
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Was geht, Süße?)
Los geht's

[Part 1: USHER & Lil Jon]
Bin im Club mit meinen Homies
Auf der Suche nach Sex, ohne Aufsehen zu erregen (Erregen)
Denn du weißt, wie es ist (Hey, hey)
Ich hab' diе Süße gesehеn, sie hat mich abgecheckt
Bei der Art, wie sie mir ins Ohr geflüstert hat, könnte man meinen, dass sie mich kennt (Kennt)
Ich hab' beschlossen, ruhig zu bleiben (Okay)
Die Unterhaltung wurde lauter (Hey)
Und ich hatte das Gefühl, sie ist bereit mir einen zu blasen
Pass auf! (Oh)
Pass auf!
Sie hat gesagt: „Komm, fang mich“ (Komm, fang mich)
Also bin ich aufgestanden und ihr auf die Tanzfläche gefolgt
Sie meinte: „Baby, los geht's“ (Los geht's)
Und in dem Moment hab' ich's ihr gesagt, ich meinte

Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte
Yeah, yeah
Dass sie und meine Freundin früher mal beste Freundinnen waren
Yeah, yeah
Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere: Sie war auf mir und schrie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Part 2: USHER, Lil Jon & Beide]
Jetzt schwirrt sie mir die ganze Zeit im Kopf rum
Sodass ich denke, es wär 'ne gute Idee, sie mit zu mir zu nehmen (Zu nehmen)
Denn sie ist bereit zu gehen (Bereit zu gehen; oh, los geht's)
Und jetzt muss ich ganz ehrlich sein (Ja)
Auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10 ist sie locker 'ne 20
Aber das bin ich einfach nicht (Hey)
Denn ich weiß nicht, wenn ich mein Glück versuche
Wohin das am Ende führt
Aber was ich weiß: Die Art, wie die sie tanzt
Macht die Süße in meinen Augen perfekt (Hey, hey, hey)
Wie sie runtergeht
Ich denk' mir so: „Ja, genauso kannst du das für mich auch machen“
Sie wollte noch eine Runde tanzen
Und ich so: „Ja, wie zur Hölle könnte ich jetzt gehen?“ Und ich meinte (Los geht's, bring den Beat zurück)
[Hook: USHER, USHER & Lil Jon, Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, Luda)

[Part 3: Ludacris, Lil Jon & Beide]
Schau hin, mein Outfit ist lächerlich
Im Club bin ich nicht zu übersehen
Und roar, diese Frauen sind alle auf Beutezug
Wenn du den Kopf still hältst, werd' ich die Kuh melken (Yeah)
Und vergiss das ganze Gelaber, jetzt mein' ich's ernst (Was?)
Ich werd' nicht aufhören, bis sie vor mir ist, wie Gott sie schuf (Yeah)
Also gib mir den Rhythmus und die Klamotten werden fliegen
Dann beug' ich dich nach vorne über und berühr' deine Zehen
Ich hab' den Jaguar stehen lassen und den Rolls-Royce genommen
Wenn sie nicht mit zu mir kommen, sollen sie eben zu Fuß gehen (Los geht's, oh!)
Was hältst du jetzt von mir
Wenn allein mein Ringfinger über 300.000 wert ist?
Lass uns trinken, ich versuch' es dir recht zu machen (Yeah)
Ludacris füllt Gläser/Körbe wie Doppel-D (Yeah)
Ich und Usher sind zurück und hinterlassen nichts als Asche
Wir wollen eine, die draußen elegant ist, aber ein Freak im Bett und schreit
[Hook: USHER, USHER & Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
[Outro: Eminem]

And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

The Weeknd - „Starboy”


[Part]
Jedem Tag YouTube am streamen, ah
Diesen Menschen sind mir zu widern, ah
Abonnisieren tu' ich niemand, ah
Deinen Videos, ich guck mir eh an, ah
Hoffemtlich tue ich dir weh, Mann, ah
Ich kann guten Deutsch, wie man seh'n kann, yah
Grammar-Nazi könn'n mich nicht belehran, ah
Das Kindergarten hat jetzt WLAN, ah
Aus Primzip lass' ich dir Dislike da
Schreibe noch beleidigender Kommentar
Wie buchstasiert man noch mal „Bastard“
Ach egal, „du Hurensohn“ geht auch schon klar
Ich hasse jeder, der dein Video liket
Ich disse jeder, der was nettes schreibt
Das ist alles gar nicht so gemeint
Ich will nur ein bisschen von Aufmerksamkeit

[Hook]
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ich kann nicht dafür
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ich bin einer kleiner Hater
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ich kann nicht dafür
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ich bin deiner kleiner Hater

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady,I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth gradethey've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to
'cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Two, don't let him in

But if her hand the gift forebears
Theyll sooner swear than pray
They're not the worst to want who lurch
On plenty with complaints
No more then those who go to church
Are eer the better saints
I hold no hat to beg a mite
Nor pick it up when thrown
Nor limping leg I hold in sight
But pray to keep my own
Where profit gets his clutches in
Theres little he will leave
Gain stooping for a single pin
Will stick it on his sleeve

For passers bye I never pin
No troubles to my breast
Nor carry round some names
More money from the rest
Im swordy well a piece of land
Thats fell upon the town
Who worked me till I couldn't stand
And crush me now Im down
In parish bonds I well may wail
Reduced to every shift
Pity may grieve at troubles tale
But cunning shares the gift
Harvests with plenty on his brow
Leaves losses taunt with me
Yet gain comes yearly with the plough
And will not let me be
Alas dependance thou'rt a brute
Want only understands
His feelings wither branch and root
That falls in parish hands
The much that clouts the ploughmans shoe
The moss that hides the stone
Now Im become the parish due
Is more then I can own

Though Im no man yet any wrong
Some sort of right may seek
And I am glad if een a song
Gives me the room to speak
Ive got among such grubbing geer
And such a hungry pack
If I brought harvest twice a year
They'd bring me nothing back
When war their tyrant prices got
I trembled with alarms
they fell and saved my little spot
Or towns had turned to farms
Let profit keep an humble place
That gentry may be known
Let pedigrees their honours trace
And toil enjoy its own
The silver springs grown naked dykes
Scarce own a buch of rushes
When grain got high the tasteless tykes
Grubbed up trees bank and bushes
And me they turned inside out
For sand and grit and stones
And turned my old green hills about
And pickt my very bones

These things that claim my own as theirs
Where born but yesterday
But ere I fell to town affairs
I were as proud as they
I kept my horses cows and sheep
And built the town below
Ere they had cat or dog to keep
And then to use me so
Parish allowance gaunt and dread
Had it the earth to keep
Would even pine the bees to dead
To save an extra keep
Prides workhouse is a place that yields
From poverty its gains
And mines a workhouse for the fields
A starving the remains

The bees flye round in feeble rings
And find no blossom bye
Then thrum their almost weary wings
Upon the moss and die
Rabbits that find my hills turned oer
Forsake my poor abode
They dread a workhouse like the poor
And nibble on the road

If with a clover bottle now
Spring dares to lift her head
The next day brings the hasty plough
And makes me miserys bed
The butterflyes may wir to come
I cannot keep em now
Nor can they bear my parish home
That withers on my brow

No now not een a stone can lie
Im just what eer they like
My hedges like the winter flye
And leave me but the dyke
My gates are thrown from off the hooks
The parish thoroughfare
Lord he thats in the parish books
Has little wealth to spare

I couldn't keep a dust of grit
Nor scarce a grain of sand
But bags and carts claimed every bit
And now theyve got the land
I used to bring the summer life
To many a butterflye
But in oppressions iron strife
Dead tussocks bow and sigh

Ive scarce a nook to call my own
For things that creep or flye
The beetle hiding neath a stone
Does well to hurry bye
Stock eats my struggles every day
As bare as any road
He's sure to be in somethings way
If eer he stirs abroad

I am no man to whine and beg
But fond of freedom still
I hing no lies on pitys peg
To bring a gris to mill
On pitys back I neednt jump
My looks speak loud alone
My only tree the've left a stump
And nought remains my own

My mossy hills gains greedy hand
And more then greedy mind
Levels into a russet land
Nor leaves a bend behind
In summers gone I bloomed in pride
Folks came for miles to prize
My flowers that bloomed no where beside
And scarce believed their eyes
Yet worried with a greedy pack
They rend and delve and tear
The very grass from off my back
Ive scarce a rag to wear
Gain takes my freedom all away
Since its dull suit I wore
And yet scorn vows I never pay
And hurts me more and more
And should the price of grain get high
Lord help and keep it low
I shant posses a single flye
Or get a weed to grow
I shant possess a yard of ground
To bid a mouse to thrive
For gain has put me in a pound
I scarce can keep alive

I own Im poor like many more
But then the poor mun live
And many came for miles before
For what I had to give
But since I fell upon the town
They pass me with a sigh
Ive scarce the room to say sit down
And so they wander bye

Though now I seem so full of clack
Yet when yer' riding bye
The very birds upon my back
Are not more fain to flye
I feel so lorn in this disgrace
God send the grain to fall
I am the oldest in the place
And the worst sereved of all

Lord bless ye I was kind to all
And poverty in me
Could always find a humble stall
A rest and lodging free
Poor bodys with a hungry ass
I welcomed many a day
And gave him tether room to grass
And never said him nay

There was a time my bit of ground
Made freemen of the slave
The ass no pinard dare to pound
When I his supper gave
The gipseys camp was not afraid
I made his dwelling free
Till vile enclousure came and made
A parish slave of me

The gipseys further on sojourn
No parish bounds they like
No sticks I own and would earth burn
I shouldn't own a dyke
I am no friend to lawless work
Nor would a rebel be
And why I call a christian turk
Is they are turks to me

And if I could find a friend
With no deciet to sham
Who'd send me some few sheep to tend
And leave me as I am
To keep my hills from cart and plough
And strife and mongerel men
And as spring found me find em now
I should look up agen

And save his Lordships woods that past
The day of danger dwell
Of all the fields I am the last
That my own face can tell
Yet what with stone pits delving holes
And strife to buy and sell
My name will quickly be the whole
Thats left of swordy well2Embed"

crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'

The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and

My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...

VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?

MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...

VOICE #1
Mother?

TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?

TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....

VOICE #2
Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?

TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?

TONY
Me jail? No way.

We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.

MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?

TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.

MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?

TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?

MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.

The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.

TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.

MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?

TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.

His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.

MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?

TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)

MAN #3
And this?

He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.

TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.

MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?

TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.

TONY
Some Canadian tourist....

MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)

TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?

Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.

MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?

MAN #3
(walking out)
I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.

TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

Man #3 at the door stops, looks back.

TONY
Send me here, send me there. This.
That. Nothing you can do to me
Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

That taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the
immigration theme, we:

DISSOLVE TO
7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A
The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.

Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

MANNY
Seat's taken.

TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.

Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

TONY
So what'd you tell them?

MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.

TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

The bus pulling out now.

MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.

TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.

MANNY
Fuck you Tony....

TONY
You did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.

DISSOLVE TO
8 INT. TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8

A movie projector...
...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.
Time to go to sleep.
(closes his eyes
but not for long)

CUT TO

9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9
Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.

TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!

TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....

He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.

TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.

MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.

TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.

MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....

TONY
I know.

MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.

TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!

MANNY
Yeah, sure.

TONY
Hey, c'mon.

Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.

CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.

MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.

CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.

MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....

CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---

MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?

CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.

MANNY
A real snatch?

CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.

As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""

He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.

He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

TRANSVESTITE
(passing)
What about you sugar -- you wanna party?

TONY
(passing her)
Yeah with whose cock, honey?

CUT TO

10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.

Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.

VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?

Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.

He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?

ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!

TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.

ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.

Manny catches up to Tony.

TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?

MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,

TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.

Angel comes over, listens.

MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!

TONY
Oh yeah?

MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.

TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.

MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.

ANGEL
Oh shit!

MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....

TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!

MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?

TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?

Tony winks and walks off.

The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.

TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'

CUT TO

11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER


Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.

TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....

The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.

MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!

Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.

ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?

TONY
I got better things to do.

ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?

TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?

(looking zd)
Let's walk.

They walk.

MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?

TONY
Yeah.

MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?

TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?

Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.

MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.

TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.

As Rebenga, in long-lensed closeup, nervously smokes a
cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.

CUT TO
13 MONTAGE - THE RIOT - FREEDOMTOWN - DAY

The visuals are swift, dispassionate and documentary-like.
The refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate,
carrying bricks and wooden slats.

ALL
(in unison)
Libertad! Libertad!

14 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND STATE POLICE
form ranks outside.

15 REFUGEES
flee through a hole in the fence.

16 GUARDS
move on them, wielding clubs.

17 SEVERAL REFUGEES
are scooting down a highway.

18 POLICE DOGS
on chains are glimpsed.

19 REFUGEES
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack.

20 REBENGA
a cigarette in his mouth, nervously hurries into a barrack.

21 ANGEL
tracks him, signals....

22 INSIDE - REFUGEES
are pulling apart their beds, going for the wooden slats.
Others set fire to their mattresses.

23 THE POLICE AND GUARDS
are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.

24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.

25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.

Manny runs up on him.

Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.

Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.

TONY
Rebenga!

Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.

TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!

The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.

...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.

26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.

DISSOLVE TO

27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER

An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.

It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.

End of montage. Music continues.

DISSOLVE TO

27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""

Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.

TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?

MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.

TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
Millionaire.

MANNY
How do you know?

TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.

MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...

A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.

TONY
Hey baby what you say?

She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....

TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.

TONY
Come on?

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.

Tony walks over to him, mocking.

TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.

MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....

As they walk off, backs to camera.

TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?

MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.

CUT TO
28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....

The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.

The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....

. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.

MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?

CUT TO

29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.

Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.

MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.

TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?

MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...

TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.

His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.

COOK

Hey you two, outside! You got company...

MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!

TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....

CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....

Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.

OMAR
I got something for you.

MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?

OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.

MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.

TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?

Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.

TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.

MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...

TONY
Shaddup!

Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.

OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?

TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.

Steps forward. Manny grabs him.

MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....

In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.

OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.

WALDO
What about them Indians ---

The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.

OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?

TONY
You kidding.

OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.

MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...

Tony says nothing.

OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?

MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.

OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...

MANNY
No problem.

OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.

Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.

TONY
I'm scared.

MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.

TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.

MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?

TONY
So what does it matter?

MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?

Tony strips off his greasy apron.

TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!

COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.

TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.

Throws the Cook his apron.

What the fuck you gonna do!

TONY
Look after my investments.

31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.

The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.

32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.

MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!

At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.

CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.

MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....

Camera revealing the teenager.

TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.

MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?

ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.

MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?

ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.

As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.

MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,

CHI-CHI
Angel?

ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...

TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.

Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.

TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.

TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?

ANGEL
Sure thing.

As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:

TONY
Let's go....

CUT TO

33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.

34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.

TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....

Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.

TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.

The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?

Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.

TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

TOAD
I'm Hector...

Pause.

TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.

TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.

TONY
You know Omar.

TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.

TONY
Okay...

TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?

TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?

TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.

TONY
Yeah well I don't got it either, I
got it close by, too.

TOAD
Where, in the parking lot?

TONY
No. How far's your stuff?

Tony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel
out... The Lizard staring at him...

TOAD
Not far.

Pause. Everything seems okay.

TONY
So what do we do, walk in and start over?

TOAD
(changes subject)
Where you from?

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.

TONY
What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?

TOAD
I like to get to know who I do business with.

It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
move somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,
coiled and always watching.

TONY
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.

TOAD
Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...

TONY
Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?

36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
commotion.

ANGEL
Tony!

Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek, like a bird.

LIZARD
(slang Spanish)
Don't! Get up! Now shithead!

She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.

The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
Columbians, ""The Kids"".

They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.

As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

TONY
Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.

Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

TOAD
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?

TONY
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits

Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins
assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

CUT TO:

37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across
the street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.

38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.

39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny looks at his watch.

CUT TO

40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

Tony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
bathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
Angel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're
dead and they know it.

Toad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.

TOAD
(to Tony)
You watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.

Lizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who
nods and turns on the whirring machine.

The Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly
towards Angel.

The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his
brains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

Lizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.

The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.

TOAD
Now the leg, hunh?

A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

CUT TO

41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They
signal and separate.

CUT TO

42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.

TOAD
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.

He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
his blood, piss dead.

CUT TO

43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
notice.

At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...

CUT TO

44 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - 'DAY
The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
shower.

The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

TOAD
Last chance, carajo?

Tony, devastated, spits in his face.

TONY
Go fuck yourself.

Toad's eyes narrow meanly.

Kid one slaps the tape across Tony's mouth.

Kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to Tony's
wrist.

The Toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly there's a
gunshot from the hall.

45 INT./EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.

Manny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid
one, who is turning, in the neck.

Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.

The Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.

Manny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.

Manny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.

The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.

In sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.

In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

Chi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.

He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

Tony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.

TONY
I got him!

Manny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.

Chi-Chi sees Angel, gags.

CUT TO
46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46
The senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter
in astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

Their eyes follow.

As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts. He stands behind the Toad.

TONY
(Spanish)
Your turn, cabron!

The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.

Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.

The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then
an old lady faints.

The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.

CUT TO

47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.

TONY
Manny, you okay?

Manny nods.

TONY
Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!

CHI-CHI
Si!

48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM
Tony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
and busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.

Inside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.

He shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.

CUT TO
49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony
hurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)

Past the senior citizens who are retreating inside their
rooms.

The camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars
come screaming past them from the opposite direction.

CUT TO
50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
The booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.

TONY
Yeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.

OMAR'S VOICE
(shaken)
Look, let me check it out right away!

TONY
You do that, Omar, you do that.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the money?

TONY
Yeah -- and I got the yeyo.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the yeyo? Bring it here.

TONY
Fuck you. I'm taking it to the boss myself. Not you. Me.

OMAR'S VOICE
Okay, okay. All right. Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway. Look, meet me tonight at Hector's at eight.

TONY
Hey Omar...

OMAR'S VOICE
Yeah?

TONY
That was some pick up you sent us on.

Pause.

OMAR'S VOICE
What's that mean?

Tony hangs up, walks back to the sedan.

CUT TO

51 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - NIGHT
on Bricknell Avenue in a swank high-rise district adjacent
Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, the hub of South Miami...

The doorman shows Omar, Manny, his side bandaged, and Tony, carrying the suitcase, through giant glass portals, past seriously armed security cops in the lobby.

52 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52
A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?

TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.

LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.

TONY
Okay Frank.

Frank shakes hands with Manny.

LOPEZ
Howya doing?

MANNY
(awed)
...Fine yeah.

TONY
Manny Ray, he was with us on the job.

LOPEZ
(to Manny)
I hear you caught one?

Manny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.

MANNY
Just the flesh. Went right through.

LOPEZ
(heading for the bar)
Yeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.

TONY
(glances at Omar)
Yeah. Omar's terrific.

LOPEZ
Not to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.

TONY
You don't have to mention it. That was fun.

LOPEZ
(smiles, likes the kid's balls)
Scotch? Gin? Rum?

TONY
Gin's fine.

LOPEZ
(pouring)
Yeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.

TONY
Yeah... well.

Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.

TONY
...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.
(produces the money)
It's my gift to you -- from me.

Pause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.

LOPEZ
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....

He glances hard at Omar who squirms.

Without opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes
the suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.

LOPEZ
Don't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!

They drink the toast. With their eyes.

LOPEZ
Then you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.
(drinks)

TONY
Yeah, I hope I have that problem someday.

Lopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.

LOPEZ
Where the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?

The big bodyguard exits smoothly.

LOPEZ
(to the others)
The broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.

TONY
I guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
Yeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?
(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)

TONY
Yeah sure, I could eat a horse.

ERNIE
Here she comes, Mr. Lopez.

TONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.

LOPEZ
Oooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.

She doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.

**ALTERNATIVE**
LOPEZ
Where you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.

ELVIRA
You're always hungry, you should try starving.

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.

ELVIRA
Hello.

TONY
Uh... hi.

MANNY
(equally impressed)
Yeah, hi.

ELVIRA
I assume we're going to be a fivesome.
Where are we having dinner?

FRANK
Oh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.

ELVIRA
Again? If anyone wanted to assassinate
you, you wouldn't be too hard to find.

LOPEZ
(coming toward her, laughing)
Me? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.

ELVIRA
You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.

Neatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.

ELVIRA
Come on, Frank, let's go.

Tracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.

Lopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.

LOPEZ
Okay, let's go.

CUT TO
54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.

55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
The interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.

The crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
young, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, ""Celebrating"" or ""Partying Down Tonight"".

The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
and high heels.

Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
tough-looking tank tops with ""Motherfuckah"" and ""Fuck Me""
written on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.

MANNY
So whaddaya say, hunh?

He flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.

CHICK
You got a buck?

MANNY
Sure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?

CHICK
(indicates the machine)
Put it in, let's play.

MANNY
I had other things in mind.

CHICK
You check out on this and we'll talk about other things.

MANNY
(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)
Fuck, how do you play this thing?

CUT TO
56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56
Frank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug
of champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Over there that's Ronnie Echeverria.
Him and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....

Their point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.

LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.

Their point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.

LOPEZ
...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....

Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.

LOPEZ
. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?

TONY
'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?

LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.

ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.

The girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.

LOPEZ
That's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.
(eyeing Elvira)

HEAD WAITER
There you go, Mr. Lopez.

He's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.

LOPEZ
Give it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?

Head Waiter nods.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Five hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
In France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.

Tony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.

57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
A Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.

LOPEZ
Hey, George -- buddy.

MAN
Hey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?

The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.

LOPEZ
Oy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.

SHEFFIELD
Jack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.

LOPEZ
Yeah, almost everything.

SHEFFIELD
(to Elvira)
Elvira, you look terrific...
(to all)
Enjoy yourselves.

He ambles off.

LOPEZ
. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.

Tony looking off at him, remembering it.

LOPEZ
(raising his champagne glass)
So... here's to old friends...and new friends.

They toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.

LOPEZ
Well, Tony?

TONY
Hey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.

Lopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.

LOPEZ
(checking Tony's threads)
Yeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.

Omar doesn't like it but glances away.

TONY
Hey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.

The music shifts to slow dancing.

ELVIRA
(waving away cigar smoke)
So, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?

LOPEZ
Dance? I'd rather have a heart attack.

ELVIRA
(rising)
Don't foam into the Dom Perignon.

Glancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
How about you?

Tony nods sure, looks at his boss.

LOPEZ
(waves)
Go on!

They go.

58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.

LOPEZ
(to Omar)
What do you think?

OMAR
I think he's a fucking peasant.

LOPEZ
Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.

CUT TO
59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59
Tony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel
dance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in
the legs and shoulders.

TONY
...so what's your name, Elvira what?

ELVIRA
St. James.

TONY
Elvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?

He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.

ELVIRA
Baltimore...

TONY
Baltimore? Where's that?

ELVIRA
Look, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.

TONY
Just trying to be friendly.

ELVIRA
I've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.

He makes a point of looking at her.

TONY
Hey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.

ELVIRA
Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?

Tony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.
The man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony
doesn't see.

TONY
Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?

ELVIRA
(interrupting)
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.

TONY
Why you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?

Elvira laughs at him, furious.

ELVIRA
You know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.

TONY
(interrupting)
Now you're talking to me, baby!

ELVIRA
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.

TONY
Hey, thataway.

She whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.

CUT TO

63 CAR - DAWN
Tony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.

They've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.

TONY
That chick he's with... she loves me.

MANNY
(driving)
Oh yeah, how you know that?

TONY
The eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.

MANNY
You're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.

TONY
What are you kidding -- he's soft.
I seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.

Pause.

63-A OMITTED

64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the
American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American
leaving Miami please bring the flag?""

Tony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.

TONY
I shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...

MANNY
I want a line of bluejeans with my name on the
chicks' asses.

TONY
Yeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,
We never gonna score the big money working for Frank.

MANNY
Frank's okay.

TONY
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit? You thinkin' like
a chickenhead again

MANNY
Frank's got an organization.

TOW
Organization? I got more brains than Omar and he's bigger than me, That's not an organization. That`s a disorganization. What do you do for a brain man? Piss in it?

MANNY
Fuck you, somebody oughta shoot you, put you outta your misery
(seeing something)
Hey catch this tomato

Catching the eye of one of two young Girls passing, Manny
primps for them.

MANNY
Ooooh baby doll

TONY
Yeah, what do you girls say? you manna have some
ice cream with us somewhere?

They glance at Tony and Manny and hurry on.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin',

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you did know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
provoking Manny's laughter. Manny double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sengre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it...

TONY
Oooh ...cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.

Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.

TONY
Come on!

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.

Tony walks up to him, mocking.

TONY
I'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.
This country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls. Por Los cojonesl

MANNY
Hey Tony, last time this year you was in a fuckin' cage in Cuba. Why don't you take it easy Chico, slow down, one step at a time, be happy what you got you know? You get on your death bed you look around you think to yourself, when was I ever happy?

Camera moving with Tony as he glances in an elegant window displaying jewelry.

TONY
You be happy. I want what's comin' to me when I'm alive not when I'm dead.

MANNY (shakes his head)
Yeah, what's comin' to you Tony?

TONY
The world man, and everything in it.

As he goes into the store, the camera panning to the diamonds in the window.

CUT TO

65 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY
The house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.

66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY
From his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced
up and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of
gifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.

TONY
Be back in an hour okay.

MANNY
Okay... be cool.

Tony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.

67 EXT./INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
Tony's Mother opens the door.
A stout aging woman with a powerful face, she's shook to her roots.

TONY
(gently, in Spanish)
Mami... long time....

MAMS
No postcards from jail, hunh?

He doesn't offer to kiss her nor she him.

Pause.

Someone else is in the house. Mother looks behind her.
She opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.
He steps in. He looks.

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.

TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina...

GINA
Tony?

She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)

TONY
(covering his unwanted emotion)
Yeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....

He holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.

TONY
I got this for you, no big deal but....

GINA
Oh Tony!

Gina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his
arms, grasping him fiercely.

GINA
...it's you!

Tony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.

GINA
I never thought I'd see you again -- never!

Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.

TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?

Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.

TONY
...Yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
""To Gina From Tony. Always.""

GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....

The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.

TONY
...for you too Mama, look....

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.

GINA
It's beautiful... Mama,
(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')

Mama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.

TONY
(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)
Well anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!

Tossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a
bottle of champagne.

TONY
Oye ! To America!
(singing)
'America. America....'

CUT TO
69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,
as Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.

GINA
. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?

Tony nods.

GINA
It's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...

TONY
Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
with starting today. I didn't bring
up my kid sister to work in no hair
shop....

Mama looks over at him on the words ""bring up"" and he
catches her look.

TONY
...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.

He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
starts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,
looks.

TONY
(to Mama as he counts)
Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise
you. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.

Pushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.

TONY
That's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.

She approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the
bills, then looks back at her son.

MAMA
Who'd you kill for this Tony?

GINA
(aghast)
Mama!

TONY
I didn't kill nobody Mama,
(lying)

MAMA
No? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?

TONY
C'mon Mama. Things are different.
I'm working with this anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....

MAMA
Sure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....

GINA
(springing to her feet)
What are you saying Mama! He's your son!

MAMA
Son? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a
bum now!
(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)
Who do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....

TONY
Hey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....

MAMA
(continuing)
No, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --
(emphasizing it)
I raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy
money with you, it stinks!

She casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him
like dead lettuce.

A silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.

GINA
Oh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.
(to Tony)
I'm sorry Tony, I....

Tony nods his head at his mother.

TONY
(gently)
Okay, Mama, okay....
CUT TO

70 EXT. TONY'S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 70

Tony walks out icily.

MANNY
(waiting in the car, seeing his expression)
Relatives, hunh? A pain in the ass,
they ---

TONY
Shaddup!

He's climbing into the car when Gina hurries out the house.

GINA
Tony!

MANNY
Hey who's that?
Checks himself in the rearview mirror, slicks his hair.

Tony and Gina talk next to the car.

GINA
Tony-.-Mama -- since Papa took off....

TONY
Hey forget Papa, we never had one, okay? He was a bum!

GINA
(continuing)
. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?

TONY
(making light of it now)
Hey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.

GINA
Tony, I know you did some bad things
back then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.

TONY
Communists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.

GINA
Mama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.

Pause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.

TONY
Hey I know... I know.

She gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.

TONY
Say, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?

She hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.

TONY
Go on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?

He gets in the car. She peers in.

GINA
You can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?

Her eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.
He smiles back with charm.

Gina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw. The sedan drives off.

71 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 71

MANNY
(driving)
cone, you -never told me you had
Hey,
such a good-looking doll for a sister!

Tony looks at him icily.
TONY
Stay away Manny, don't ever let me catch you fuckin' around with her, don't ever fuck around with her....

MANNY
(feeling heat)
Sure...sure.

A beat.
CUT TO

72 MONTAGE - PASSING TIME 72
Music accompanying the flipping of calendar leaves.

73 U.S. CUSTOMS - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 73
Tony, spruce in his new three-piece suit with the diamond on
the finger and the expensive watch, looks like the young
ethnic American businessman in import-export as he steps in
front of a chunky, young Customs Officer, who looks at him coldly.

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Mind opening that, sir?

Tony, calm, unzips the chic leather single suitcase, his
eyes drifting around....
A woman, with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage, is cursorily checked through an adjacent line.
A nun is waived through the third line.
A stockbroker waiting in a fourth line, glances nervously in Tony's direction.
Tony looks away, back at the Officer who is thoroughly
ransacking the suitcase looking for a false bottom. He waits, confident.
An old man is waived through a fifth line,

75 EXT. DOLLY STASH'S HOUSE - MIAMI - DAY 75
The mother-type unscrews the handles of the baby carriage,
pulling out the wrapped cocaine, while Chi-Chi extricates
another load from the kid's panda bear which is now in
shreds.


76 THE OLD MAN 76
helped by Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom
from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.

77 MANNY AND GASPAR 77
break open wooden clothes hangers concealing cocaine as the stockbroker changes clothes.

78 THE MOTHER 78
picks up the baby and removes cocaine from its diaper.
While:

79 THE FORMER NUN 79
in partial habit, steps out of the toilet, adjusting her underpants; she places a package of cocaine on a table, on which we now see approximately five kilos stacked.

80 TONY 80
counting out the cash for his mules, Omar there, overlooking the operation.

81 MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 81
Again. But this time going out.

The nun, now a housewife, going through an exit gate carrying hand luggage.

82 TONY 82
watching, glances up at the electronic information board and the boarding gate--
Houston clocks out the time.-- we move to Los Angeles -- ""on time"" ---

Tony's eyes moving to the mother, now without the child,
buying her ticket at the counters.
Manny joins him, nodding okay.
Tony, with a glance at his watch, starts out the terminal.
The roar of the aircraft blending with city sounds as we continue the rapid pace of the montage with music.

86 EXT. GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86
Frank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.

87 INT. LAUNDRY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 87
The plush millionaire's restaurant is to be seen again.
Frank has his arm around Tony, introducing him to a business-type. Elvira looks on.

88 INT. HIGH-FASHION STORE - DAY 88
In a high-fashion store, Tony buys a beautiful dress for Gina who is delighted when she sees herself in the mirror, hugs Tony. Manny watches, unable to take his eyes off her.

SALESLADY
(admiringly to Tony)
Your wife looks terrific in that.

TONY
My wife? You gotta be kidding.

89 INT. LOBBY - LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 89
Elvira steps out in a Pucci summer dress, looks around. Tony is waiting for her. She's surprised.

TONY
He got held up at the golf club. He told me to pick you up. He`ll meet us at the race track.

Elvira contemplating him with distaste.

TONY
He said if he was late to get Ice Cream first.

She sighs, walks across the lobby. He follows.

90 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 90

Elvira steps out of the lobby into the driveway.  He points.

TONY
Over there....

She looks. The car is a yellow Cadillac convertible with 2
big fins and Snoopy the dwarf dashboard statue with stickers
all over the fenders. Adding to the impression are Manny
and Chi-Chi waiting in the backseat.

ELVIRA
(registers it with distaste)
That thing? You must be kidding.

TONY
(hurt)
Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.

ELVIRA
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.

TONY
It's got a few years on it but it's 'a creampuff.'

ELVIRA
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

91 INT. LUXURY MOTOR SALES - CORAL GABLES - DAY 91
Camera moves around a slick, red Jaguar -- XG 6 -- with Tony, accompanied by Manny, Chi-Chi, the Salesman. Elvira waits aloofly off to the side.

TONY
(to Elvira)
So you like this better?

ELVIRA
(shrugs)
It's got style.

TONY
Yeah it looks like one of the tigers from India.

MANNY
(to Elvira)
Tony been dragging me around to the zoos, looking at tigers. He wants to buy one of them too.
(amused)
He do that he gonna have no friends left. Not that he got any now.

TONY
You'll like the tiger Manny, you'll see.

ELVIRA
You going to drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat Tony?

TONY
Yeah... maybe some lady tiger.
(to Salesman)
How much?

SALESMAN
Twenty-eight thousand dollars. Fully equipped.

TONY
(genuinely)
That all?

SALESMAN
Machine gun turrets are extra.

TONY
(circling the car)
Funny guy hunh... Manny, c'mere.

Manny comes over and Tony walks him along the car, in
quieter tones.

TONY
Get these sections bullet-proofed... here... here... these windows...

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
...and a phone with a scrambler.

MANNY
Okay...

TONY
...And one of those radio scanners, y'know, pick out flying saucers and stuff.

MANNY
Yeah, a good one.

ELVIRA
(joining them)
Don't forget the fog lights.

TONY
Yeah, in case I go to the swamps, good idea.

ELVIRA
(impatiently)
I thought you were taking me to Frank?

TONY
(glances at his watch)
We still got an hour. You hungry?

ELVIRA
No, but I'm bored.

TONY
Figgers. Check it out, will you Manny and pay the guy and grab a
taxi out to the track....

Thanks, yeah....

TONY
(before leaving)
Oh yeah.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private joke. He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, ""Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag.""

Elvira wonders about it as he joins her.

TONY
Somebody gotta keep the animals out.

92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92
Tony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.

TONY
I'm glad you came. I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.

ELVIRA
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?

TONY
Yeah -- you know who.
They get in the car.

ELVIRA
And what would Frank say?

She has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then
other, then takes a last hit through the mouth.

TONY
I like Frank.. -but I like you better.

He reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,
staring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He
kisses her. She goes with it.

Pause. She pulls back.

ELVIRA
(same tone of voice as before)
Don't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.

As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.

CUT TO
INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.

Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.

SOSA
So this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...

Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose.
Pause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.

SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.

OMAR
That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.

SOSA
Yes, it would've been nice if he could have come.

TONY
(cutting in)
and he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?

SOSA
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)
So he sent you?

TONY
Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.

Looking over the laboratory like it was his.
Omar glances at him, annoyed.

SOSA
We'll talk at my house. Shall we go...

CUT TO
94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94
The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

SOSA
(to Omar)
...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.

OMAR
Well, we do that, we gotta take the
risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You
know what that means?

TONY
That means we gotta go to war with
`em.
looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make
Sosa
of this guy.
SOSA
When we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.

TONY
Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.

SOSA
Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.

TONY
13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You
know what that's like these days?
They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.

Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

SOSA
What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.

Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.

The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
A beat.
He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

OMAR
(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)
Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!

Tony shrugs.

SOSA
Where were we?

TONY
Panama. You're looking for a partner, right?

Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.

SOSA
...something like that.
(chuckles)

OMAR
Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...

TONY
Hey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.

OMAR
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!

TONY
(shrugs)
Frank'll love it. Don't worry about it.

OMAR
That's up to Frank -- not you.

He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing
-- also an advantage in the split.

OMAR
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...

SOSA
It's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to
Frank.

OMAR
(a beat)
Okay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.

SOSA
(without hesitation)
Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.
You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.

Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.

OMAR
Yeah. I guess so....

TONY
Great.

SOSA
(glancing at Tony, to Omar)
...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.

OMAR
(doesn't get it)
I don't think that...

TONY
(lighting a cigar)
Hey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...

Sosa laughs. Omar scowls.

CUT TO

95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95

The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:
Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.

The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.

Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

TONY
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?

SOSA
Why?

TONY
Cause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.

Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

TONY
(overlapping the joke)
They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.

SOSA
Maybe he'll move to Miami too...
Gabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?

Sosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.

GABRIELLA
(distracted)
Lovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.

SOSA
I'll take care of it myself.

GABRIELLA
(turning to him)
...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.

SOSA
Of course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...
(to Tony)
My fiance, Gabriella Montini.

TONY
Hello....
She nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.

GABRIELLA
It's a pleasure.

She withdraws. Tony watches her go.

TONY
I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.

SOSA
(focusing the binoculars)
I like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel
the same way about the rest of your organization.

Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.

TONY
In-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?

SOSA
I mean Omar Suarez.

Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.

Sosa passes him the binoculars.

SOSA
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.
From several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....

Tony, astonished, looks up.

96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96
terrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.

SOSA
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.

Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
A silence.


97 TONY 97
shaken, lowers the binoculars.
Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.
Tony looks back at him, contemplative.
Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.

SOSA
So how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?

TONY
(awry, stalks up to him)
Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.
That piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..
For all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!

SOSA
(moves away)
I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this
Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.

TONY
Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.
(then)
You got my word on that.

Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,
makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony
following the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.

SOSA
You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.

Their eyes locked together.

In all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach
and rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.
Music theme continuing over.

REVERSE WIPE TO

99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99
In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
outside his office.
He jerks his head. Inside. They go.

CUT TO
100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100
The office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,
Cuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on
JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares
incredulously at Tony.

LOPEZ
(livid)
You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars
without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy!

TONY
Hey take it easy Frank, cone.

LOPEZ
Con0 my ass!

TONY
At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank... we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank. Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.

LOPEZ
Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.

TONY
Frank... Frank...

LOPEZ
(ranting)
You know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?
...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.
Cause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?
(pause, eyeing Tony)
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?

TONY
You saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?

Lopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.

LOPEZ
(carefully)
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall
your deal with Sosa.

Long pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.

TONY
(finally)
...have it your way boss.

He turns to leave, nods to Manny.

LOPEZ
Montana... just remember I am the boss.

TONY
Sure you're the boss.

Gets to the door, Manny joining him.

LOPEZ
Y'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.

Tony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.

101 EXT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE 101
Just outside the door, Tony glances at Manny's question-mark
expression.

TONY

Fuck him!

102 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 102
Tony, impeccable in Cardin whites, and Manny, also slicked
up, are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office.
Behind the desk sits the heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed lawyer,

George Sheffield smoking yet another cigarette, his voice a
hoarse gravelled croak, the eyes -- with their deadpan stare
-- always pausing before they speak. He doesn't get up from
his desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the
Mutiny Club.

SHEFFIELD
What can I do for you Montana?

TONY
(indicates Manny)
My partner. Manny Ray.

Manny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes
briefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.

TONY
So George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.

SHEFFIELD
Did they also tell you how expensive I am?

TONY
Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.

SHEFFIELD
I see you been reading your American history Montana, what've you done lately to earn a place in it?

TONY
(chuckles)
I'm trying to stay outta it, y'know
what I mean? I'm expanding my operation. So I want a class guy like you on the payroll -- advising me. Starting now.

SHEFFIELD
(a longer pause than usual)
Cash. On the table.
...Start with a $100,000.

TONY
(an equal pause)
Sure...

He sticks out his hand. Manny slaps an envelope in it. Tony
begins counting out the cash, right on the tabletop.

CUT TO

103 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - DAY 103
Tony waits in his red Jaguar in the driveway of the building.
Lopez and his bodyguard exit the building.
A limousine pulls up.
Tony watches.
The threesome get in the limo and drive away.
Tony gets out of the car, crosses to the entrance.

104 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 104
Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face. She`s
in jeans, barefoot and casual.

ELVIRA
Tony?

TONY
Hi there.

Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
explanation. There is none.

ELVIRA.
ml.. -you just missed Frank.

TONY
I didn't come here to see Frank.
She looks at him amazed. The balls on this guy!

ELVIRA
(cooling to him fast)
This is not the time or the place.
Next time make an appointment first.

She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
bulls in.

TONY
I got something important to tell ya.
Why don't you make some drinks and act normal.

ELVIRA
Sure. Why not? We're all normal here.

She heads for the pool, nonplussed. Tony closes the door, eases slowly across the room towards her, awkwardly trying to make conversation.

TONY
I heard you was in Europe travelling 'round all by yourself. Woman like you shouldn't have to travel alone...
(pause, no response)
I been travelling myself.

ELVIRA
Broadening your intellect. I heard.

TONY
What else d'you hear?

ELVIRA
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.

TONY
Yeah. It makes things easier this way, don't it?

She's puzzled. He drinks a toast.

TONY
Here's to the land of opportunity.

ELVIRA
For you maybe.

She drinks to it.

TONY
Hey, do you like kids?

ELVIRA
Kids? Sure, why not -- as long as there's a nurse.

TONY
Good. Cause I like kids too. I like boys and girls.

She's waiting. He paws the ground, awkward as a bull.

ELVIRA
That's broad of you, Tony. Travelling really helped. Look, Frank's going to be back any moment and when he walks through that....

TONY
Yeah. Yeah -- fuck Frank. Look, here's the story. I'm from the gutter but I climbed out of it. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here in Miami. I could  be like Frank but bigger -- The biggest!

Elvira's looking at him like he's on the moon.

TONY
Anyway what I came up here to tell you is that.. .uh I like you. I think you're terrific. I known this the first time I seen you. You belong to me. We're tigers. The two of us... I want you to marry me and be the mother of my children.

Silence.

ELVIRA
(stunned)
Me? Marry you?

She laughs, a short harsh laugh.

TONY
(sincere)
Yeah... -marry me.

ELVIRA
What about Frank? What are you going to do about Frank?

TONY
Frank's not gonna last...
(puts down the drink, puts his hand on hers)
I'm not looking for an answer right now Elvira, but I want you to think about it, okay? I want you to think hard... I'll see you the next time.

He goes. She stares at him, still dazed, yet deep down -- flattered.

CUT TO

105 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105

The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
refined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out
of his path, he angles through them.

OWNER
(indicating a table)
Over here.

Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.

TONY
What the fuck is she doing here, she's....
(heading towards her)

MANNY
(stops him)
Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake. What do you give her money for if you don't want her to go out, have some fun?

Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves back. Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.

TONY
Who's she with?

MANNY
Some kid, he works for Luco, he's harmless....

Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him. Caucasian,
about 250 pounds.

TONY
Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
don't dance too close.

MANNY
Sure Tony.
(drifting away)
I'll be at the table.

LARGE MAN
(intersecting)
Hello Tony, you remember me?


TONY
(to the Large Man)
Yeah, sure. You're...
(snaps fingers trying to remember)
...Bernstein, right. Mel Bernstein.
Narcotics, right?

BERNSTEIN
That's right, Tony.
I think we better talk.
(indicates a quieter area)

There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's cause just the eyes do the smiling.

TONY
Talk about what, what's there to talk about? I ain't killed anybody
lately.

BERNSTEIN
No not lately but we can go back to ancient history.
Like Emilio Rebenga, like a bunch of whacked Indians at
the Sun-Ray Motel in Miami Beach....

TONY
Oh yeah? ...you know Mel, whoever's giving you your information must be taking you guys for a long ride.

BERNSTEIN
Are we gonna talk or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls, Tony baby -- here and now?

Tony looks at him.

CUT TO
106 INT. BABYLON CLUB - CORNER TABLE - TONY AND MEL 106
in a corner of the Babylon -- talking.

BERNSTEIN
Yeah, so the news on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo
Tony... that you're no longer a small-time hood, you're public property now, and the Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded....

TONY
No shit -- how much?

BERNSTEIN
(doodling on a piece of paper)
There's an answer to that too....

He holds the paper up briefly in front of Tony. It says ""25,000""

TONY
(reacts)
That's a big number.

BERNSTEIN
That's on a monthly basis. Every month the same thing. You know how this works, don't you? We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me. When we hit, it hurts -- Same thing works the other way. You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.

TONY
S'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?

BERNSTEIN
That's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.
(getting up)
I don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?
...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to
London, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.

Tony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.

BERNSTEIN
I like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.
But you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.
Everyday aboveground's a good day.

He winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.

Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.
Tony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....

107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107
Elvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,
the bodyguard. Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy,
the Owner, and Elvira drifts in.
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her.
She sees him coming, glances in Frank's direction.
Tony comes right up to her.

TONY
Hi...

ELVIRA
Hello, Tony.

Lopez, in conversation with the Owner, glances over, sees
Tony with Elvira, his expression narrows.

TONY
so.. .Did you think about.what I said? About the kids?

ELVIRA
Tony, you're really nuts you know, -- you really are.

Lopez comes over, takes Elvira's arm, and smiles at Tony.

LOPEZ
Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl?

TONY
That's what I'm doing, Frank.

Tense look on Frank's face. The bodyguard circles.

LOPEZ
(without a smile)
Then go do it somewhere else. Get
lost.

ELVIRA
Frank, he was only...

TONY
(ignoring her)
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes,
man.

LOPEZ
You won't be hearing anything, you
go on like this.

TONY
You gonna stop me?

Frank is livid.

LOPEZ
You're fucking right I am. I'm giving you orders.
Blow. (Esfumate)

The bodyguard moves closer to Tony who doesn't move.

Manny suddenly slides into frame, backing Tony.

TONY
(icy)
Orders? There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.

Pause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the
crest. Lopez abruptly turns away.

LOPEZ
(to Elvira)
Let's go!

ELVIRA
Frank, this is ridiculous....

LOPEZ
C'mon!

He crowds her. she goes. Angry, Tony watches as they exit the club.

MANNY
What happened?

TONY
That cocksucker! -- He put that homicide prick Bernstein on me.

They stroll back to the table.

MANNY
What for?

TONY
The Emilio Rebenga hit. Remember that.

MANNY
You're kidding!

TONY
Who else knew about it? Omar's fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me.

MANNY
I don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony. Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York?

TONY
You go. I like the weather here just fine.

He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
stairs to the toilets.
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
after her.

MANNY
Hey, where you going?

He doesn't answer.

CUT TO
108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E
Tony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself
into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
him. No Gina.

109 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109
He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
the door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
burgundy suit running his hand along her ass.

GINA
(shocked)
Tony!

TONY
What are you doing! What are you doing!

He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
times into the wall.

GINA
(trying to restrain him)
Tony! What're you doing! You're crazy!

He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.

TONY
(to Gina)
What are you doing with this shit, hunh?
(back to burgundy suit)
Get the fuck out of here, maricon, y'hear, I'll kill you next time.

GINA
Fernando!

TONY
(to Gina)
Shaddup!

Manny runs in, several others now looking in from the hall.

MANNY
Tony!

Tony shoves burgundy suit out of the stall, past Manny.

TONY
Go on!

GINA
What the hell is....

TONY
You think it's cute somebody puttin' their hands all over your ass, my kid sister, hunh? In a toilet!

GINA
It's none of your business!

TONY
The fuck it isn't! Three dollar hooker, that's what you are.
Snorting shit like that at your age, you oughta ---

GINA
What are you -- a priest? A cop! Look at your life. You can't tell
me what to do!

TONY
I'm telling ya! I don't wanna see you in here again. I catch you in here I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.

GINA
Oh yeah! Go ahead!

TONY
You're getting outta here right now!
Don't push me baby, don't push me!

GINA
Don't fucking push me!

MANNY
Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air...

The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
the hallway. Several more people are watching.

GINA
You got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!

Tony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.
Tony stands there, abated.

The crowd is silent.

Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.

MANNY
(tender)
Come on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.
(strokes her face)

TONY
(disturbed, to Manny)
Get her home, get her outta here!

He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
no regrets, but disturbed.

Manny helps Gina to her feet.

MANNY
Come on, pussycat, I'll buy you a
cup of coffee.

CUT TO
110 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 110
Tony, isolated and edgy, reenters the main room, circling
the edges of the crowd, up to the bar.

TONY

Gimme a double of that!

He turns, catches a last glimpse of Gina leaving with Manny.

CUT TO
111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111
Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
coupe. She's still angry.

GINA
...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
Mama's right. She says he hurts everything he touches.
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
again. Never!

MANNY
He loves you, what do you want. He
feels he raised you.

GINA
He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!

MANNY
Hey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...

GINA
Against what?

MANNY
'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.

He says it like it's personal.

GINA
(picks up on it)
I like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.

MANNY
(a face)
What future's he got? On a bandstand somewhere? He's a bum, Why don't you go out with somebody who's
going somewhere?

She gives him a look.

GINA
Like who?

MANNY
Like a doctor or a dentist or something.

GINA
What about you? Why don't you take me out?

She's looking straight at him now, challenging.

MANNY
What? Me?

GINA
Yeah, you. I see the way you look at me -- Manolo Ribera.

MANNY
(nervous)
Hey, Tony's like my brother.. You're his kid sister, okay?

GINA
So what?

MANNY
So....

GINA
(taunting)
You afraid of Tony? You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

MANNY
Fuck no....

112 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112
Pulls the car over to the curb.

MANNY
I guess we're here.

Pause.

GINA
You think about it, okay, you think about it real hard, Manny. Cause you don't know what you're missing....

She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.

She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.

CUT BACK TO
113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113
The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night'.

OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?
Now I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.

He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.

Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.

Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...

...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....

Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....

The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors...
Screams, crowd diving for cover...

Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of
his ankle, firing...
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...

Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.

Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.

The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.

CUT TO
114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114
Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.

Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.

The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.

Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.

Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.

Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.

Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

CUT TO

115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115
Tony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
it, doesn't express a reaction.

DOCTOR
It's going to be sore for a few months.

TONY
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer...
(to Chi-Chi)
Find out where Lopez is....

CUT TO
116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116
Miriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with ""Cocaine"" written on it.

TONY'S VOICE
Miriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?

MIRIAM
Yeah... It's Tony.

Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror, takes the phone, in good spirits.

MANNY
Tony cabrone, whatcha doing -- checking up on me, too?

117 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT INT. 117

TONY
Look, get your fuckin' clothes on and meet me outside Lopez's office in forty-five minutes. That phonebooth on 9th. Yeah.
Move your ass!

118 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 118

MANNY
What happened!

119 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
TONY (v.o.)

Tony hangs up.

120 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 120

MANNY
(grabs his pants)
I gotta go.

MIRIAM
This is worse than fucking a grasshopper, man.

MANNY
Hey, I'm better looking.
(hits the coke again)
Don't do it all, I'll be back later.

CUT TO
121 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:
Tony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.

TONY
(to Nick)
Nick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?

NICK
Yeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.

TONY
All you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'

NICK
Yeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...

CUT TO
122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122
Waldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny
and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.

LOPEZ'S VOICE
...you're kidding! Three to two?
Son of a bitch!...
(cradling the phone)
Guess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!

MUFFLED VOICE
Congratulations. That's great Frank.

Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
with guns casually drawn.

123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123

TONY
Yeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?

Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
there and then, but manages to recover.

LOPEZ
Tony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.

Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
other side of the room.

LOPEZ
Tony... what happened to you, hunh?

TONY
Yeah, lookit. They spoiled one of
my $800 suits.

LOPEZ
Jesus! Who?

in his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

TONY
Hitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.
Never seen 'em before...Hiya
ii:;. Is there an answer to this too?

BERNSTEIN
(uneasy)
Always is Montana, always is...

LOPEZ
Jesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.

TONY
Hey, you might be right.

LOPEZ
Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.

TONY
(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)
Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.

Pause.

LOPEZ
(awkward)
Well... What are the guns for Tony?

TONY
(shrugs)
What for? I'm paranoid I guess.

The phone rings.
Lopez lets the phone ring.

TONY
Why don't you answer it Frank?

LOPEZ
Must be Elvira. You know women.
After we left that joint she....

The phone rings again.

TONY
(reaches for it)
I'll tell her you're not here.

LOPEZ
(grabs the phone first)
Wait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...
(anxious)
Yeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.

He hangs up. Pause.

TONY
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

LOPEZ
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony?

Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

TONY
You know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!

LOPEZ
Tony, no! Lissen!

TONY
You remember what a 'haza' is Frank?
It's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.

LOPEZ
(nervous)
Why would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !

TONY
Yeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the
side but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!

He squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.

LOPEZ
Mel! Mel! Do something, please!

Mel sits there impassively.

MEL
It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.

LOPEZ
Please Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll
give you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay! I'll go away Tony, I disappear, you'll never
see me again. Just gimme a chance, gimme a second chance Tony, please... please!

He sobs pathetically.

LOPEZ
I don't wanna die Tony, I never did nothing to nobody Tony! I never hurt nobody!

TONY
Yeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.

He turns to Manny.

TONY
Manny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?

Tony steps aside.

LOPEZ
No! No! Tony!

Manny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.
Lopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in
his bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.

TONY
...Every dog has his day.

He fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN
(remaining calmly in his chair)
I told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.

TONY
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.

His eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.

BERNSTEIN
Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.

TONY
I'm not Mel. You are.

He produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his
left hand pointed at the big man.

BERNSTEIN
(rising from his chair)
Hey, c'mon, what is this?
You can't shoot a cop, Tony.

TONY
Whoever said you were one?

He fires.

Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.

BERNSTEIN
I... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...

TONY
Sure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.

He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is
no longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.

MANNY
(indicates bodyguard)
What about him?

Tony notices.
The bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.

TONY
You want a job Ernie?

ERNIE
Sure, Tony.

TONY
Come see me tomorrow.

ERNIE
Thanks, Tony.

Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.

MANNY
(Offscreen)
Okay, torch it!

CUT TO
124 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - THAT NIGHT 124

Elvira lies in her silk sheets. The doorbell rings. She
gets up.

In a nightgown, she opens the front door.

ELVIRA
Tony?

Tony, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling, moves past her into the apartment.

ELVIRA
What's happened?

Tony just stands there.

ELVIRA
Where's Frank?

TONY
Where do you think? ...Why don't you go pack your stuff. We're going home.

Pause. She understands, moves quietly past him towards the
bedroom.

Tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace,
breathing in the air. The lights of Miami wink at his feet...

. . . the camera moving to one sign down there that says it
all, flashing its big neon bracelet ---

In an exclusive area of Coral Gables, surrounded by walls,

canal. Tony has erected his fortress-like Shangri-La, to
which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
sign on the front lawn that says:
THE WORLD IS YOURS

MONTANA TRAVEL CO.

Just like it should be.

. . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely short dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina, her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her, evenly and openly as....
Tony and Elvira kiss.

151 EXT. TONY'S GROUNDS - SAME DAY 15

Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira, nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.

Across a moat of water, a striped nine-foot Bengal tiger stretches majestically under a solitary banyan tree, extending a giant claw and licking himself.

Tony and Chi-Chi kidding around with the tiger.

back to the mansion as Chi-Chi throws the Bengal his wedding

CUT TO
151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B

Tony, accompanied by Manny, walks a young, thirtyish bank
president into his office, which is rigged with video monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.

There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs -- but not one sign of a book on the walls.

Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who never stops thinking money.

TONY
...yeah, well, I can't pay that no more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money. So I think it's time you bank boys come down a bit, y'know, like....

BANKER
Hey, Tony, c'mon, that's crazy, I can't do...

TONY
That's too bad, cause....

BANKER
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation here, we're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give us the harder it is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.

TONY
You gonna what, Jerry?

BANKER
Tony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.

TONY
Ten points!

we go someplace else.
Hey, Tony,

BANKER
Tony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it. You're not gonna find a better deal.

TONY
Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the Bahamas myself.

BANKER
You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a regular basis? Once maybe. And then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with twenty million of your hard-earned dollars? C'mon Tony, don't be a schmuck -- who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.

Tony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting
he has another engagement,

BANKER
Stay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.
See you. Take care.

Going.

Tony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:

TONY
That prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's
come over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....

So why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.

TONY
I don't know. Mob guys -- guineas -- I don't trust 'em.

On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker, leaving. Now beginning to see things through the glass darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually -- passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.

TONY
(eyes wandering across to another video monitor)
You get the house sweeped this month? The cars?

MANNY
Yeah, sure, I told you that. Five thousand it set us back.

TONY
See that cable truck there?

152 INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - VIDEO MONITORS 152
Tony's eyes fixing on the cable TV truck parked across the
street.
A man is hauling cable.
There are other private gates visible. The area is lush with gardens, Spanish moss, cypresses and quietly respectable million dollar houses with their Spanish tile roofs and balconies.

MANNY
Yeah?

TONY
Hey Manny when does it take three
days to rig a cable, hunh?

MANNY
Cops.

TONY
What if it's the Diaz brothers? What if they're gonna come and get me?

MANNY
I'll check it out.

TONY
You check it out, then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Bogota.

MANNY
The truck could be anything. We're not the only dopers living on the block y'know.

TONY
Hey you got some attitude y'know Manny -- for a guy in charge of my security.

Hey I'll check it out. I'm just telling you we're spending too much
on this counter-surveillance shit. Twelve percent y'know, of our adjusted gross -- that's not pocket money.

TONY
You worry about it, it lets me sleep
good at night. There's that fat guy
again.

Manny looks over at a jogger running by the gate -- of the
porcine quality, civilian-looking, fifties.

TONY
I seen him every day. 'Bout a week now.

MANNY
So the guy jogs around the neighborhood. He's some fat accountant.

TONY
How the fuck do you know what he is?

MANNY
Hey if he's a cop, don't you think running in circles around a house is a pretty dumb way to watch it?

TONY
Maybe not...
(walks away, stops, looks back)
I'm telling you we're getting sloppy -- our thinking -- our attitude.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!

TELEVISION COMMERCIAL
A television spot for Florida Security Trust (or Miami Security Trust or Dade Security Trust depending on legal options). A respectable business-type walks along the sidewalk with a renascent downtown Miami as a backdrop. Skyscrapers, glinting glass, cranes....

BANK SPOKESMAN
Here at Florida Security Trust we've
been putting your money to work for a
better America. We've been around for seventy-five years. We'll be here tomorrow.

A logo for the firm over with the reminder ""Since 1907.""

Camera pulling back to reveal Tony watching in his huge gold-
leaf bathtub, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looks
like a character in a Futzie Nutzie loafing cartoon, with his
TV hooked to one side of the tub, a long phone line to the
other, and a radio and portable bar all within reach.

TONY
(to the TV)
Yeah that's cause for seventy-five years you been fucking all of us over, that's why.
(to Manny)
Somebody oughta do something about these whores. Charging me ten points on my money and they're getting away with it! There's no laws anymore,anything goes.
Listen, these guys been here for a thousand years. They got all the angles figured.

Manny straddles a chair next to the tub watching the m
news that was interrupted by the Florida Security Trust
commerical. Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself
up in front of a giant mirror. It's some bathroom --
gigantic with a chandelier hanging in the middle of it,
Italian marble, plants, skylights, rugs, etc....

TONY
You know what capitalism is --
Getting fucked.

ELVIRA
A true capitalist if ever I met one.

She's doing a toot of coke off a flat mirror.

TONY
How would you know, bubblehead? You ever do nothing 'sides get your hair fixed and powder your nose? You do too much of that shit anyway.

ELVIRA
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that Tony.

TONY
Know what? Why do you always got to talk like that?

MANNY
(changing the subject)
So I had a pow-wow with this guy
Seidelbaum today. He checks out.
I  got another meet set up.

TONY
When?

MANNY
Thursday ten o'clock. I thought I'd take Chi-Chi with me. Do a million and some change. Get my- feet wet with this guy.

TONY
That's a lot of wet. I'm not Rockefeller. Not yet.

Tony points to a figure on the TV.

TONY
Hey, listen to this, guy's always good for a laugh.

Visual of silver-haired television Anchorman -- Vic Phillips -- with a bit of show business image in him -- to be seen again. Underneath his face, it says ""Editorial.""

NEWS ANCHORMAN
...the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated $100 billion a year business? It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them. These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element...
(pause for effect)
I am not one of those voices.

TONY
(responding)
What do you know -- you never been right in your life, Vic baby...
(to Manny)
Guy never fuckin' tells the truth.
It's the guys like him, the bankers and the politicians who want to keep the coke illegal so's they can make more money and get the votes to fight the bad guys. They're the bad guys.
They'll fuck anything for a buck....

ELVIRA
And what about you Tony? Can't you stop talking about it all the time, can't you stop saying fuck? -- it's boring, it's boring!

TONY
What's boring?

ELVIRA
You're boring. Money, money, money!
That's all I hear in this house. Frank never talked about money.

TONY
Cause Frank was dumb.

ELVIRA
You know what you've become Tony -- an arriviste, an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking about how much money he's got or how he's getting fucked. Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.

TONY
What're you talking about, I worked my ass off for all this.

ELVIRA

It's too bad. Somebody should've given it to you. You would've been a nicer person.

What is my problem, Tony?

TONY '.
...you got nothing to do with your life that's what.

MANNY

Who do I trust -- me, that's who....

DISSOLVE TO

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
""CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160
The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
moving, talking.
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.

The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
look the part.

It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.
At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.

LUIS
. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
I was in that picture down in Columbia.
Burn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.
We're good friends. I was his driver...

NICK
(stacking)
Oh yeah?

LUIS
Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.
(pause)
Yeah, I also know Paul Newman. I worked with him in Tucson.

NICK THE PIG
That so? Say, you know Benny
Alvarez there?

LUIS

(interrupting to Tony)
Now you want a company check here for $283,107.65?

TONY
(pause, checking his fingers)
Uh... I come up with 284.6

SEIDELBAUM
(pauses, looks again at his figures)
No, that's just not possible. The
machine don't make mistakes.

TONY
Well, we'll count it again.

SIEDELBAUM
Oh Jesus!

TONY
Hey business is business. We're talking $1500.

SEIDELBAUM
(exasperated)
Okay, you keep the change okay, I don't give a shit.

TONY
Okay but I'll go through it again with you.

Seidelbaum ignores it, counting up another stack.

SEIDELBAUM
Okay... This check now, this one goes to the...

TONY
Montana Realty Company.

NICK
(to Luis)
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?

DISSOLVE TO

161 INT. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY
They're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke
filling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest
of green and they're still counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their eyes.

SEIDELBAUM
We're up to what?

LUIS
(consulting his notes)
Seven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.

TONY
(grins)
Hey we're almost finished. Another 200 thousand and we can take a leak.

SIEDELBAUM
Yeah, but this'll do fine.

Pulls a pistol from his ankle and rises.

SEIDELBAUM
You're under federal arrest, Montana,
for a continuing criminal conspiracy.
The RICO Statute. Get 'em up.

Tony astonished.

TONY
Oh shit... You're not kidding hunh?

Eyes darting. Considering the options. The little fat man's eyes are suddenly agile and mean-.-Tony reads them, lifts his arms.

SEIDELBAUM
(to Luis)
Get it.

Luis moves around Tony to disarm him.

TONY
So how do I know you guys are cops?

Luis, produces a wallet with identification, shoves it under Tony's nose.

LUIS
What's that say, asshole?
Insert: Photograph and Drug Enforcement Agency ID.

TONY
(impressed)
Hey that's good work, where can I get one of those?

LUIS
Cabron! You call yourself Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up.

SEIDELBAUM
Looie! Cool it.

TONY
(unfazed; wiping the sweat off)
Call your dog off, Seidelbaum. I wanna call my lawyer.

SEIDELBAUM
Lotta good he's gonna do you Montana. There's an eye there in the wall.
(points)
Say hi, honey....

162 IN'P. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY - REVERSE ANGLE ON VIDEOTAPE
Blurry image of the men in the room. Tony is not that
clear an image as he glances briefly, uninterested, into the camera.

TONY
Yeah, is that what you jerk off in front of Seidelbaum?

NICK
Oh shit and I was supposed to meet this chick at three. What a pain in the ass.

SEIDELBAUM
(to camera)
Okay, Danny, turn it off.
The angle goes black.

SEIDELBAUM
(reciting the Miranda)
All right, Montana, you have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can be taken against you. You have the....

TONY
(cuts him off)
I know all that shit, Seidelbaum, save your breath. It ain't gonna
stick. You know it, I know it. I'm here changing dollar bills is all.
So you wanna waste everybody's time here, I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami. He's so good tomorrow morning you're gonna be working in Alaska, Seidelbaum....

CUT TO
165 XNT. TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 165

Tony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts his
hair. A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,
goes out. It's the first time we sense he might be using
the stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.

CUT TO

166 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Tony is pacing nervously. Manny looks on. Red-headed
Sheffield rasps through a cloud of cigarette smoke behind
his desk.

SHEFFIELD
. ..you give me a check for a hundred grand plus three hundred in cash and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge. But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion -- and they'll get it.

TONY
What am I looking at?

SHEFFIELD
Five years, you'll be out in three, maybe less if I can make a deal.

TONY
For what! Three years in the can!
For washing money? This whole country's built out of washed money!

MANNY
Hey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.

Tony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an
epileptic fit.

SHEFFIELD
I'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.

TONY
No...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

SHEFFIELD
Tony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.

Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
Sheffield's desk.

TONY
All right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell
you about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?
I'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.

Pause.

SHEFFIELD
(cool)
The point is made. Now where's the money?

Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
desk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
hands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.

167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167
Camera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside
gallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with
several other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their
coffee after lunch.

SOSA
(rising)
Tony...Tony.

TONY
Alex.

They hug like they were the closest of friends.

SOSA
I'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?

TONY
She's okay. How's your wife?

SOSA
Three more months.

TONY
That's great.

SOSA
And you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.

TONY
(sore point)
I'm working on it.

SOSA
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.

They laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with
him than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.

SOSA
Tony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.

He smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.

SOSA
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.

PEDRO QUINN
A pleasure, Mr. Montana.

Camera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music
assuming a faint martial stride.

SOSA
General Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.

The man is in civilian clothes.

SOSA
Ariel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.

The cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who
nailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-
type in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.

SOSA
Charles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.

TONY
Hi....

GOODSON
How do you do, Mr. Montana...

He smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.

SOSA
Nicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.

The black aide goes.

SOSA
(solicitous)
Tony, come, please sit here.

Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
surrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the
proceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.

He suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
moving with another woman past a window of the house. Then
she's gone.

Sosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching
knees.

SOSA
Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....

TONY
Sure, Alex.

SOSA
Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.

Tony waits.

SOSA
We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....

Pause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
gaze away.

TONY
And your problem, Alex?

Sosa looks around, stands up.

SOSA
Come, I'll show you.

Tony cautiously stands to follow him.

CUT TO
168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168
MATOS STUDY
A ""Phil Donahue-type"" setting. A segment now in progress
with the ""Donahue-type"" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.
Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion.

GUTIERREZ
More than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It
sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!

INTERVIEWER
I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.

GUTIERREZ
The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,
Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.

INTERVIEWER
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

GUTIERREZ
(laughs)
Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --

Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV
screen, dour, ruthless.

GUTIERREZ
. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?

Laughter.

169 TONY 169
watching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from
the coke usage.

SOSA
A Communist -- financed by Moscow.

170 GUTIERREZ 170
holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the
TV screen.

GUTIERREZ
...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....

INTERVIEWER
What are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?

GUTIERREZ
(passionate)
The United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.

171 TONY 171
staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.

GUTIERREZ
You Americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....

Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.

SOSA
...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...
That's our problem.

TONY
Yeah.

Sosa looks up.

The Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into
the room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over
Tony. The Skull leads him in.

SOSA
You've met Alberto before?...

TONY
(remains seated)
Sure. How could I forget?

SOSA
Alberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.

Alberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.

SOSA
(to Tony)
So you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...
(*en)
Is that a problem, Tony?

Tony looks around the faces, then:

TONY
That's no problem, Alex....

Alex nods, pleased.
Hold on Tony. He blows his nose again.

CUT TO

175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT
A millionaire's place, like ""The Forge"" on Arthur Godfrey
Road. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.

TONY
Hey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.

Vic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--
cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a
patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.

VIC
Oh, is that so?

TONY
Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?

VIC
Aren't you... Tony Montana?

TONY
(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)
Yeah, that's me.

The half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.

TONY
(waves to them)
Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.

Waves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.

MANNY
(reproving)
Hey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....

TONY
I don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!

Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
of an anguish he does not understand.

CUT TO

173 TONY
sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....

MANNY
So what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?

TONY
Lot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.
The whole world's turning into politics.

He pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.

MANNY
The one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.

TONY
Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?

Manny remembers.

TONY
No free rides in this world, kid.

MANNY
So who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?

ELVIRA
What guy?

TONY
(to Manny)
You stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.

He takes a hit, unnoticed.

ELVIRA
(unheard)
What guy?

MANNY
(to Tony)
I don't like it.

TONY
You don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

What's Seidelbaum got to do with this?
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
Elvira's untouched plate.

TONY
Why don't you eat your food, what's
wrong with it?

ELVIRA
I'm not hungry.

She quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-
ment of her hand.

TONY
So what'd you order it for?

ELVIRA
I lost my appetite.

She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.

MANNY
(trying to shift the mood)
So what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....

Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.

TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
Is that what it's all about?

MANNY
It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....

TONY
(doesn't hear)
. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?
(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)
A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!

MANNY
(gently)
Tony, you're drunk.

TONY
...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it
man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!

Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.

ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!

They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.

ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!

The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVIRA
. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons
around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?
(in a softer tone)
Oh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...

Silence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's
this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
their lines.

TONY
(softly)
Go on, get a cab home, you're stoned.
(to Manny)
Manny.

ELVIRA
No, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't
even know it.

TONY
All right I'm stoned.

MANNY
(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)
Come on, baby.

ELVIRA
No, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...
(staring at Tony)
I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.

Pause. She starts wobbling out.
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.

TONY
Let her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.

Stumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.
Tony's eyes follow her. Pause.

The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
food, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food
and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

TONY
You're all assholes. You know why?
Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.

He wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony
shakes him loose.

TONY
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.

He starts out, staggers.

TONY
So say good night to the bad guy...
You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.

He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
and delight.

CUT TO
174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT
A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
moves into frame.

Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
under the car.

Tony looks:

175 ERNIE
down the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying
traffic, signals okay.

176 CHI-CHI
waits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.

Tony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
snort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
under.

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
axle of the car.

177 ERNIE
signals.

178 TONY
sees it.

A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
towards us.

Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
Tony hurries to the car, bends down.

TONY
(Spanish)
Psst! La Jara! Apaga.

The Shadow douses it and freezes in position.

Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.

Tony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.

TONY
Hey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?
Jesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.

FEMALE COP
Why don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....

TONY
The ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?

FEMALE COP
(in a hurry)
Look it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.
(signal to her partner, they drive off)

Tony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to
the car, bangs on the hood several times.

TONY
Hey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!

178 CONTINUED 178
Pause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.
gun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's
a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck you doing!

TONY
(winks)
Hey that was close, hunh?

CUT TO
179 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - DAY - EARLY NEXT MORNING 179
Ernie, Chi-Chi, and the Shadow huddle cold and uncomfortable in the sedan, waiting -- eating pizzas and drinking beers. The morning has come down ice cold.

180 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK - DAY 180
At the phone booth up corner, Tony -- the unshaven, bleary-eyed -- is rapping on the phone.

TONY
. . . Yeah, _ yeah...nah, nah...you tell Sheffield keep his nose out of it, there's not gonna be no trial, I got everything under control, yeah... Have you heard from Elvira?

He waits, hangs up, snorts some more, impatient. He picks up the phone again, starts dialing.

181 INT. TONY'S NEW YORK SEDAN - DAY 18:
In the sedan, the Shadow peers over, angry, at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck's he doing now! That sonufabitch....

182 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK r DAY 18;
In the booth, Tony, snorting another nostril, moves back
and forth as the phone rings at the other end. Finally she
picks up.

ELVIRA'S VOICE
Yes?

TONY
Hello baby, how's Baltimore?..hey look Elvie, I been thinkin' 'bout us, you know and....

The phone goes dead. Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.

183 OMITTED 183

184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184
He gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him
with the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back. Tony, seemingly unaffected by the weather, reaches for an open pint of ice cream, starts eating it with a plastic spoon.
He alternates ice cream with coke through the scene;the
dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half-eaten
Chinese food.

The Shadow, disgusted with all this mess, restrains himself,
staring out at the street with a hate-filled expression,
saying nothing.

CHI-CHI
(concerned)
Everything okay Tony?

TONY
Yeah roses. Where is this fuckin' guy?
I don't got all day to piss away.

CHI-CHI
Probably fucking his wife.
(eating pizza)
Jeezus it's cold.

185 THEIR POINT OF VIEW THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
The door of the brownstone. No movement. Though now
there's increasing traffic on the street and passing pedestrians.

TONY
. . . we oughta shoot him when he comes
out the door, save a lotta bullshit.

186 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

CHI -CHI
What's so important about this guy anyway? What's he, a Communist?

TONY
(snorting through his mouth)
Nah he's no Communist. He's a kinda symbol, that's what he is.

CHI-CHI
What the fuck's that mean -- symbol?

TONY
It's like when you die, your life meant something to somebody, y'know? It wasn't like you just lived it for yourself, but you did something for the rest of the human race too...

Tony snorts another line -- seen through the rearview mirror.

CHI-CHI
(nods his head somberly)
Yeah?

TONY
Me, I wanna die fast. With my name written in lights all over the sky. Tony Montana. He died doin' it.

CHI-CHI
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony, you ain't gonna die.

TONY
(doesn't hear him)
...So I'll end up in a coffin. So what? The cockroach fires the bullet's gonna end up in a coffin just like me. But I lived better when I was here. And that's what counts.

Pause.

TONY
(nervous, to Ernie)
Ernie, what time?

ERNIE
Ten to.

TONY
(opening his door)
I gotta call Manny.

He starts out the door. The Shadow barks out something in
preemptory Spanish.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Sit down!

TONY
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, you,...

CHI-CHI
Tony, he's coming!

187 EXT. MATOS' STREET - DAY
Tony looks around, sees:
Matos coming out the door, briefcase in hand.

Tony gets back in the car.

188 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos gets into his sedan a quarter block down from his front door.

189 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony staring.
The Shadow, most excited of all, like a panther that just
spotted his prey, eyes alive for the first time.

190 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos sits there warming up his car, looking back at the brownstone.

191 XNT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

Tony breaks open a fresh vial.

TONY

Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like.

The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who
doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.

SHADOW
(Spanish; to Chi-Chi)
What's he saying! You tell him stay inside thirty metres of the car okay -- no more you just stay inside thirty metres.

TONY
(English)
Hey, okay, I heard you the the first time. One time okay. Just tell me one time.

I tell you thirty metres okay! You understand, madre de dios, why this hop-head is driving!

CHI-CHI
Okay, okay.

TONY
(English)
Okay, okay, cool it willya, all right.

192 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos pulls his car out of the parking space.

Tony puts his car in gear, prepares to pull out when:

Matos stops his car, backs up -- in the direction of his front door.

TONY
What the ---

Matos comes to a halt, double-parked, honks.

193 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
What's he doing? Where's he going?

194 MATOS' BROWNSTONE - SIDEWALK - DAY
The wife opens the door, steps out -- followed, moments
later, by two schoolchildren, books in hand. Matos waves
to them to come along.

195 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony looks astonished, back at Chi-Chi.

TONY
What the fuck! You said the wife took `em in the other car.

CHI-CHI
She did boss. She did it every fuckin' day, I swear!

196 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 196
The two children are now climbing in the back of Matos'
sedan, the wife getting into the pasenger seat. They drive off.

197 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 19:
Tony, upset now, goes to his vial, snorts, turns sharply to
the Shadow.

TONY
Hey Chico, no fuckin' way! No wife, no kids! We hit this fuckin' guy we hit him alone okay.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now.
We do it.

He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos,
muttering to himself.

TONY
...aw fuck this, this fuckin' asshole!

Chi-Chi, in the back, looks on worried.

198 NEW YORK STREETS - DAY - FOLLOWING MATOS' SEDAN
through Manahattan, towards the UN.

The Shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder. He now sticks a key in it. A red light pulses at intervals.

Tony, driving, glances, the tension building in him, he
does another giant snort.

Matos' sedan, swerving out into traffic to pass a car, has
a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.

The Shadow goes nuts, peering over the dashboard to see if
the bomb came loose.

SHADOW
(to himself, Spanish)
Madre de dios, my bomb! -- don't you fuckin' fall, my little baby!
Perspiration starting to break out on his forehead.

Tony also feels the sweat coming on.

TONY
(muttering)
...this is fuckin' crazy, man, this is sloppy doing it this way, you
don't do it like this....

He honks furiously at a cab that tries to cut him off.

199 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony, intense at the wheel, sneezing, his nose running.

SHADOW
(equally tense, in Spanish)
You're losing them! There! That street, they go that street!

TONY
I see 'im! I see `im!

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Thirty metres! Thirty metres! Go! Go!

TONY
Shut the fuck up!
Honking like a madman and accelerating past a truck....

TONY
...what am I doing? What the fuck am I doing here?...

200 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 200
sedan pulling off at 47th and Second Avenue heading
Mato's
for the United Nations building which now appears at the
end of the street.

201 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 20:
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Okay, now...now. Right here.
Easy. Easy!
The decoder.

Tony snorts.

TONY
(muttering)
Aw, fuck you, you fuckin' vulture....

The Shadow in stark profile.
His finger depresses the first key of the decoder.

UNDER MATOS' CAR - DAY
202 20;

The bomb -- pulsing red light.

203 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 203
The Gutierrez sedan pulls off the sidestreet into the thick
of First Avenue traffic -- approaching the striking facade
of the United Nations.

204 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 204
The Shadow is in a full sweat.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
...okay, okay, nice 'n' easy...at the corner... when he pulls up at the corner.

His finger hovering around the second key of the decoder.

Chi-Chi in the back, leaning forward across the seat.

TONY
(muttering)
Two kids in the car, Jesus Christ!

205 UNDER GUTIERREZ' CAR - DAY 205
The bomb -- jarred by -a bump, pulsing red light.

206 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 206
Gutierrez' sedan inches its way out of the traffic and eases along the curb.

207 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 207
Tony honking his way through traffic after them, building
to a climax with himself.

TONY
(muttering)
...bunch of fuckin' vultures. You don't have the guts to look 'im in the eye when you kill him, you gotta hide, you fuckin' vulture.

Honk, honk.

SHADOW
Shut up!

CHI-CHI
(suddenly panicked)
He's gonna get out! Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

TONY
(ignoring all the commotion)
makes you feel good, hunh?
Killing the wife and the kids. Big man. Well fuck you! What do you
think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman. Well fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life.

His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Beretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, leveling it on the Shadow.

TONY
Motherfucker!

The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps
two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.

CHI-CHI
Oh Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the....

Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic
around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as
the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday
morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered
up against a passenger window and nobody really sees...
except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she
wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.

TONY
(continuing to mutter)
...so what'd you think I was, hunh?
A fucking worm like you! I told you don't fuck with me! I told you no kids! You shoulda listened to me you stupid fuck!

209 EXT. JFK AIRPORT - THAT NIGHT
Planes roaring.

210 INT. JFK AIRPORT
Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
on them.

TONY
Ernie? Where the fuck you been?

ERNIE'S VOICE
I had a delivery. Tony, everything go okay, whatsa ---

TONY
Fuck no? Where the hell's Manny? I been calling all over.

ERNIE'S VOICE.
I don't know, Tony. He's been gone last couple of days. Didn't say nothing.

TONY
What! Where! I left that sunufabitch in charge! What the hell is going on here, can't I trust anybody anymore.

ERNIE'S VOICE
I don't know, Tony, he just took off, y'know, he didn't say nothing...
you all right?

TONY
No, I'm not all right. I'm pissed off! And when I 'get there I'm gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin' place!

ERNIE'S VOICE
When you coming back, Tony?

TONY
Tonight!
(repeating to himself)
Where the hell is that cocksucker?
I can't trust nobody no more. You think just cause I'm a nice guy....

ERNIE'S VOICE
Uh, Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone. She got to see you right away.

TONY
Gina's gone? Where! Oh fuck! ...Tell her I'll be there tonight. Okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Right.

TONY
(about to hang up, pauses)
uh -- how 'bout Elvie -- did she call?

ERNIE'S VOICE
(a beat)
No.

TONY
Yeah, okay, okay... listen if she calls, tell her I love her, okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Yeah, okay Tony.

Tony hangs up. A moment of despair. Then he snorts
another spoon and snaps back.

212 EXT. TONY'S MANSION - THAT NIGHT 212
Tony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained clothes, rushes in.

213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213
Ernie meets them at the door.

TONY
Hear from Manny?

ERNIE
No Tony. Your mama called again.
She gotta see you. And Sosa's been ringing every half-hour on the eleven line. Tony, he sounds pissed, he....

TONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Chi-Chi, get him on the line. In the office.

Chi-Chi goes.

TONY
What about Elvie -- anything?

Ernie shakes his head.

TONY
You keep trying Manny. I need that cocksucker, you hear, I need him here! Okay?

ERNIE
Right, Tony.

Tony stalks off, towards his office.

214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE

Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
and stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

TONY
Yeah? Hi. Mami.

Her voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.
The other phone is ringing.
Not really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.

Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.

TONY
(into the phone)
Yeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!
No problem, okay.

He hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.
The telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.

TONY
. . . so whaddaya say Alex?

Pause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very
cold.

SOSA'S VOICE
So what happened Tony?

TONY
(casual)
Oh we had some problems.

SOSA'S VOICE
Yeah, I heard.

TONY
How'd you hear?

SOSA'S VOICE
Cause our friend gave a speech today at the UN. He wasn't supposed to give that speech.

TONY
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, your guy Alberto was apiece of shit, he didn't do what I
said so I cancelled his fuckin' contract.

Pause at the other end.

SOSA'S VOICE
e . . M-y partners and I are pissed off.

TONY
Hey Alex, no big deal. There's plenty other 'Albertos'. So I'll
deliver the goods next month.

SOSA'S VOICE
(suddenly angry and letting Tony know)
No! We can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony. And our friend's got security now up the ass. And the heat's coming down hard on me and my partners.
There's not gonna be a next time. You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!

TONY
Hey, you don't talk to me like that!
Who do you ---

SQSA' S VOICE
(simultaneous)
I told you a long time ago, you little fuckin' monkey, not to fuck me and....

Tony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.

TONY
Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think
I am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re
shit! You want a war, you got it?

Slams the phone down.

TONY
The fucking nerve of that guy!

In the cavernous silence of the room, he listlessly turns to another line of coke.

CUT TO
215 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 215
Tony in the backseat in his white Corniche staring straight
ahead. Ernie driving, Chi-Chi with him.

216 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - NIGHT 216
The bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi
getting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
You try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.

He hurries towards the house.

217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:
Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
previously, as if overwhelmed by events.

MAMA
. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.

TONY
The Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?

You ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....

TONY
I never gave her that kinda money.

MAMA
Yes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...

TONY
Mama, was there a guy with hex?

MAMA
I don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....

Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
by the shoulders.

TONY
Where's this house, tell me!

MAMA
Citrus Drive. Four hundred something.
Four hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
Exactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.

He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.

MAMA
Don't you see what you do to her?
Don't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....

TONY
(shakes himself loose, turns on her)
No! You know why she left, Mama?
Not cause of me. Cause of you.

MAMA
Me?

TONY
Yeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Nagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?

TONY
(continuing)
...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --
never good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!

MAMA
(interrupts)
. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....

TONY
First time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .

MAMA
Where was I?

TONY
...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.
I hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?

MAMA
(interrupts)
You ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....

TONY
That's right! That's right. What did you expect!

MAMA
(interrupts)
.that's what you brought into this
i&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....

TONY
What do you expect now? To be loved?
You got no love in you, Mama.
What do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Somebody? You're proud? You're a
(Escoria!)
nothing. You're an animal!

Tony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.

MAMA
God help me, what have I done to you?
You were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....

Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.

218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218
Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly
closing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips
open her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the
doorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony
takes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.
CUT TO

219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219
Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies
the house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,
not calling attention to itself.

Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the
crystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
Wait here.

He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.
Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.

MANNY
(surprised)
Tony?

Tony stares, stunned.
Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a
big smile of welcome for her brother.

GINA
Tony!
(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)

Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.

Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.

MANNY
Hey Tony, c'mon we was....

The gun fires.

GINA
Tony! No!

Tony fires a second time.
Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.

Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
Manny lies at his feet, dead.

GINA
Manny!

She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.

GINA
Manny!

She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.

GINA
You killed him?

Shaking her head at him incredulously.

GINA
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.

Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.

GINA
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?
What'd he do?

She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes
horrible strangled sounds with her throat.

Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.

CHI-CHI
Tony, come on. We gotta get out of here
(to Gina)
Come on baby...Gina!

Suddenly she goes berserk.

GINA
Noooooooooooo!

And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.

Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.

220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220
Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.

Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
the pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.

ERNIE
(to Chi-Chi)
Get the body!

Tony, back at the door, looks down again.
The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.

Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.

CHI-CHI
Tony!

Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.

TONY
Yeah!

He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.
Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.

The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.

GINA
Manny! ...Manny! No!

CUT TO -
221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221
The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.

222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222
It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,
gravel flying.

The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the
shadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.
Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.

223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223

Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the front
door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting
for them at the door.

Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.

CHI-CHI
What do we do with her Tony?

TONY
Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
Put her in my bedroom.
(to Gina)
It'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take
care of you....

She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.
They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.

224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224
Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.

Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.

CHI-CHI
We got some pills into her, she's cooling down.

Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.
Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.
Pause as he lets it sink in.

CHI-CHI
(worried)
Boss, what we gonna do now?

TONY
Do? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.
We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that
fucker down.

Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.

CHI-CHI
(eyeing the coke)
Hey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?

Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.
Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.

Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.

CUT TO
225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225
The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.
A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.
The monkeys listen quietly.
The flamingoes flutter.
. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...

. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.
. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
balustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically
catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

TONY
(insensate)
. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....

His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.
Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!

TONY
...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...
Well what the hell happened, hunh?
What the hell happened to us?...

In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:

The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring
out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.

Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.

A third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate.

On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
incoherent.

TONY
...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would
you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...

As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:

TONY
...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....


226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226
As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.
Tony sees her.
She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.

GINA
Is this what you want Tony?...

Tony shocked.

GINA
You can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.

She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.

The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.

GINA
I'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.

Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.

GINA
Come and get me Tony. Before it's too late.

He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.

GINA
Come on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---

ERNIE
Get outta here!
Tony, they're everywhere!

Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.

TONY
(gently)
Hey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.

Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.

TONY tx:
Come on Gina, get off the floor.
You're all dirty now, you need a bath...
Mami's gonna be angry baby
-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..
Come on open your eyes my baby,
open your eyes.. -give me a smile.

There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
pounding it.

CHI-CHI
Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!

On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
goes off, blows him up against the door.

TONY
Cheeee!

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.

On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.

Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,
talking to himself.

TONY
So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.

Karroooomph!
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.
It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.

Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

TONY
Whores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?

Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

TONY
Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!

Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
away. Laughing like a madman.

TONY
You need an army you hear! An army to kill me!

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

The Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.

Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below.

He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.

As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.

The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:
""THE WORLD IS YOURS""
And so, for the brief moment, it was.

Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word ""Chivato"" in blood on the outside walls,
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay

And hues of green for passing years

So we will show them love instead
We'll paint the whole world red
We'll paint the whole world red

I can feel time in my veins
Counting down my days
I won't paint them grey with pain

The good and evil sides

Everyone I encountered in Berlin seemed to have the freedom—economically and culturally—to do exactly what he or she pleased. What was important was what was happening right now. Nobody seemed to hold anybody to account. It wasn’t like San Francisco or New York, where the first question anybody asked at a party was what you did for a living, and the second was where you lived and how much you paid to live there. The other reason was that, perhaps because of that freedom, Berlin felt like the center of something surprising and important, and I couldn’t help thinking it would be a good place for an aspiring writer. The rumors of a new Lost Generation were a terrible cliché, but it was hard to resist them.
I applied for a Fulbright, figuring I could do with at least the imprimatur of institutional legitimacy. My proposal—some essay I planned never to write about contemporary young German novelists, about whom I knew exactly nothing—was the sort of thing I’d been advised the committee wanted to hear, and I got it.

Twenty-seven was an unusual age to move to Berlin, but I’d always had a precocious sense of crisis, and my decision to go was spurred at least in part by my fantasy that I might be able to stave off future regret. I felt like I owed the experience to some subsequent self. Everybody else in Berlin was either twenty-two, just out of leafy liberal arts colleges and in flight from the responsibilities ahead, or they were thirty-nine, just out of a career or a relationship and in flight from the responsibilities behind. For my part, I moved there as a kind of preemptive strike, reasoning that if I bolted while I could, in my late twenties, I wouldn’t bolt when I couldn’t, in my forties, or maybe more specifically at approximately forty-six, when my dad left his marriage and moved in with Brett, a lovely guy he met at the gym, and my brother and I could never get in touch with him about car insurance or baseball games because the two of them were always disappearing to the nightclubs of Key West or Palm Springs. They e-mailed self-portraits in sailor suits from themed Atlantis cruises down Baja. My dad’s justification for this, in those moments when he felt as though he needed to produce one, was that he was claiming the outré adolescence he’d been denied. He’d lived a life long on sacrifice and short on pleasure, and had begun, at last, to live the life he deserved. “Deserved” was his word.

More than anything, his two mistakes—first, not living the life he wanted; and, second, believing this had been a sacrifice that freed him from all future sacrifices, like having dinner with his children when he wanted to stay longer at the bar, or treating their mother with any respect—were what I hoped to avoid. I explained my fear of regret in terms of how unusually clearly my dad’s life—in which a bad, perhaps even cowardly decision made in his twenties became a thirties of anxiety, a forties of resentment, and a fifties of abandon—exemplified the great cost of not having acted as one wished when one still had time.

I thought that perhaps my dad’s problem was that he hadn’t had enough experience, that he’d chosen a career and a marriage before he knew what else was out there, and I didn’t want to make the same error. Experiencewise, I wanted what I thought everybody wanted: to go to secret parties with artist/DJs that people in Brooklyn hadn’t even heard of, or to sleep with as many people as, say, Tom, so that when I got back into a committed relationship it wouldn’t be for the mere sake of being in one but because I’d chosen that person. Those were the reasons I gave for moving to Berlin. Or at least, those were the excuses I gave for moving to Berlin.

I arrived in time for a few days of lingering late summer. I took the U-Bahn from the airport, dropped my stuff at a sublet, spent my first euros on a pack of cigarettes, and walked slowly down the Karl-Marx-Allee toward Delia’s apartment feeling alone and free and already different. My first night in town was Delia’s send-off, which seemed cruelly unfortunate at the time. (Later I understood it was a common enough coincidence: every day somebody arrived and somebody else left.) I arrived at her apartment to find the German national women’s Ultimate Frisbee team running around in their underwear in the living room while the men smoked on the balcony, trying to decide where we’d all go later, if the women decided to put their pants back on.

In Berlin it thus seemed, from that first night’s demented relaxation into morning, as though everything was up in the air at all hours; no possibility was foreclosed. The local custom was to commit to as little as possible, and by “local custom” I do not mean “German custom.” If the twentieth century had taught anybody anything at all, it was that Germans had lousy customs. Hence Berlin’s appeal: there was no cultural arbitration. My colleagues in Paris had the futile errand of trying to resemble the French. Those in Beijing competed in the absurd contest of trying to understand China. In Tokyo, or in London, or in Moscow, your sunlit hours had to have some nontrivial relationship to the economy. Berlin was an experiment in total freedom from authority, an infinitely long weekend with your parents out of town. It felt like an anti-gravity chamber. The old crimes licensed you to ignore the claims of the past; the low cost of living licensed you to ignore the demands of the present; and the future was something that would happen when we moved back to New York, where many of us would once more live in uncomfortable proximity to our actual parents, and where people talked about real estate and restaurants.

It was not that I did not like talking about restaurants. It’s normal to like talking about restaurants. But in Berlin when we talked about restaurants, it was the cheap kebab places; this was part of the ritual by which we acknowledged the aspects of our Berlin existence that differentiated us from our friends at home. We, and now I mean the people I came to love in Berlin, David Levine and Alix and Emilie, often felt like survivors whose home planet had become glutted with condos bought by people who waited in line for cupcakes, and we congratulated ourselves and one another on having gotten out just in time. This gave our decision to do as little of consequence as possible—with this ocean of space and profligacy of hours—the legitimate pretext of cultural and economic protest. We rebelled against the authority of rent and cupcakes.

In theory, this chartered us to do whatever we pleased whenever we wanted. In practice, it meant we spent a lot of time wondering what we wanted to do, and if we wanted to do anything at all. Or maybe that was just me. Part of my anti-regret crusade involved making sure I was always doing just what I felt like, which mostly meant keeping myself open for things that might come up, saying yes to whatever distraction happened along. It was an extremely active kind of passivity and it went swimmingly at night, when things were always coming up: there were gallery openings and bars and clubs, all elbowy with asymmetrical people proving provocative until breakfast. The daytimes were another matter; then it was less clear what the most vital and necessary and memorable experience available might be. I went to Berlin with a whole shelf of unread books, books like Middlemarch, but every time I sat down hungover in a café at eleven a.m. with that copy of Middlemarch, the whole day open before me, I inevitably thought to myself, Why move to Berlin to read Middlemarch? I could read Middlemarch in San Francisco (though, naturally, I hadn’t). The whole point of living in Berlin was being an agent in the world of total possibility. Was reading Middlemarch the thing I most desired to do in that particular hour? It wasn’t easy to say. Ordinarily I had to put the book down and go on a walk to think it over, to make sure I was maximizing the value of my experience. These often turned into some pretty long walks. When I got back to the neighborhood from my walks, I sat around the Turkish bakery with Alix, or I went with her to check out the newer galleries up in Wedding. When I was with Alix, I felt as though there was nothing else in the world I’d rather be doing. When she was busy I went to see Wings of Desire.

Part of the point of Wim Wenders’s 1987 film, which I must’ve seen a dozen times in that first year, is that Berlin before the fall of the Wall had long been an inertial place, a sort of vacuum. There was no industry in the West; factory owners were afraid the Soviets would blockade the city, as they had shortly after the war. The banks were in grimy Frankfurt, technology and automobiles were in bourgeois Munich and arrogant Stuttgart, the press was in wealthy Hamburg, the provisional government in boring Bonn. West Berlin was merely a symbol of resistance, a great series of photo ops, and America was happy to help pay for it as long as it continued to provide such good press. East Berlin was just as unreal. It was a Communist set, the utopian socialism of the future, but it was also a big, expensive mock-up. The rest of the country was bankrupted by the purchase of ornamental tile for the wedding-cake palazzi that lined the Stalinallee (now the Karl-Marx-Allee I walked to Delia’s frisbee-underwear going-away). The Fernsehturm, or TV Tower, at Alexanderplatz, the city’s only height of note, had been built in 1969 as a present to the Volk from their twenty-year-old puppet government. They’d had to use Western technology and Swedish engineers, and the people were already picking up TV signals from the free side of the city. After the Wall went up, in 1961, there was never anything of true geopolitical importance at stake. Its construction wasn’t an escalation but a diffusion: it made the conflict not political but rhetorical, for the benefit of the media.

The movie follows two angels as they bum around the city. One of them becomes smitten with a doleful French trapeze artist, and his feelings for her convince him to leap from eternity into time. Peter Falk, playing himself as a former angel, encourages Damiel’s transition. In the scene where he first wakes up as a mortal, he asks a passerby for help. The man teaches him the words for the colors in the graffiti on the Wall—his life until then had been in black and white—and then gives him change for his first hot coffee and pack of cigarettes. He gulps the black coffee, his eyes wide.

This had always evoked what felt like a disproportionate response in me; it wasn’t the sort of movie that was supposed to make you cry. On some level it was probably just because I was lonely and indecisive, sitting yet again by myself on a Tuesday at one in the afternoon at the Kino Babylon or at the Moviemento, and because it ends with the inevitability of an enduring romance, which already seemed impossibly remote in libertine Berlin. But it wasn’t just that. The citizens of divided Berlin were marooned on an island outside of time. Their ability to do what they wanted to do was thwarted by their historical circumstance. But once they, like the angel, were able to pass through the Wall, they would leave behind their suspended existence and enter the swift current of life.
When the angel wakes up as a mortal, he strides away from the Wall with the assurance and the joy of the convalescent. He’s so giddy to have time—to have finite time, time that now counts for precisely something because its quantity is fixed—that he knows just how he’s going to use it. I’d been so entranced by this image that I’d missed the crucial prelude, the process by which his desires crystallize and he understands why he wants to be free: to share a fleeting life with his trapeze artist. In moving to Berlin, I was working (or not working, as the case may have been) on the assumption that a grand gesture was itself enough—that, in the wake of the decision to uproot myself, my true desires would emerge to fill the vacuum. In the nineties Wenders made a sequel to the movie that I’d never seen; the last thing I wanted to know was what happened next.

But I realize now I should have known what would happen next. One of the very first things I’d heard upon arrival in Berlin was a line from the 1920s feuilletonist Karl Scheffler: Berlin ist dazu verdammt, immerfort zu werden, niemals zu sein. Berlin is damned always to become and never to be. It was such a seductive idea, that the city would never grow fusty or calcific and that, by proxy, you would never become fusty or calcific. And if a place was always becoming, there was no time for belatedness, no great era you’d missed out on, no cost to frittering away your time doing this or that. But we were, I was, so easily seduced, I missed the part about damned.

*

For a while there, at the beginning, starting with that Frisbee panty party, things were genuinely fizzy and I didn’t at all mind spending my days just walking around and my nights saying yes to whatever happened to present itself. Just being there felt glorious, or, more than glorious, felt like enough. We felt like participants. The cigarettes, those endless stockpiles of cigarettes, and the coffee really did taste different, as they always do in a new place, and drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes felt like sufficient acts. Cigarettes marked off the time. For the few minutes one lasted, you knew exactly what you were doing: you were smoking that cigarette. When it was done, you would figure out what to do next, or you would just light another.

I arrived in Berlin with ten e-mail addresses. The first person I met, Emilie, looked at my list and said I needn’t bother e-mailing the rest; she knew them all, and I’d see them the next day at the big gallery opening. Her friend Alix was coming along, and I’d love her.

We met at Emilie’s place first, in a cobbled and uncharacteristically pretty street behind Arkonaplatz. Alix’s name was pronounced in the French style, ah-LEEX, and she arrived with a duffel bag big enough for a body.

“Where did you just come from?” I asked. “A trip? Hockey practice?”

“Nowhere,” Alix said. She’s thin and angular and striking, with pointy elbows, long, nervous fingers, and deep-set almond eyes. She has a soft rumpled tide of unruly hair and glows with a cold marmoreal light. She opened the bag and changed in front of us, into a billowy unbelted stained silk dress and Thirty Years’ War–vintage combat boots tourniqueted at the ankles.

The economic, cultural, and psychological draws of Berlin—the sheer amounts of time and space that in other cities would be taken up by day jobs or the steady emotional drain of long-standing friendships; the almost religiously shared belief in the possibility of personal reinvention; and an addiction to the promise of the new—made for a robust art scene, at least according to various multilingual periodicals. This opening was at the new outpost of a huge London gallery. The room, or rather the space—nothing took place in something as banal as a room—had the size and character of a well-swept munitions depot, and probably had served as one once. Everything in Berlin happened in a former somewhere: the former sanitation-technology factory in the Ritterstraße, the former pretzel factory in the Prenzlauer Allee, the dome of the former post office in the Oranienburgerstraße that now had a restaurant/club that would only take reservations via text message to a secret number, the former department-store-vault club that was now in the former basement of the former (current?) power station, and of course the former dentist’s office, which the white tiles heated up like a sauna. All of these rooms had been liberated from their erstwhile indebtedness to productivity.

In the former munitions depot, people dressed in lab coats angled through the crowd with purpose, and I assumed they were caterers. Once I’d become a little more familiar with art, I’d look back and wonder if they hadn’t been part of the installation, or, once I felt as though I knew even more about art, if they’d possibly been both caterers and part of the installation. After the opening we got into a cab and went to a party in Kreuzberg hosted by a fragile, fey artist in a black feathered boa and his bloodshot gallerist, who was wearing a T-shirt that said “Vulva Vaginal Scent” and chewing on lollipops. I texted a friend in San Francisco, described these guys, and asked if they were anybody I should feel pleased to be at a party with. He wrote: FAMOUS GUY SAATCHI ART CAVE OF DICKS. I tried nonchalantly to ask Emilie what CAVE OF DICKS meant and she said that the guy in the black feathered boa had once made a cave of dicks. Actual live dicks. They hung down from unsuckably distant glory holes in the ceiling.
A sometimes-celebrated young conceptual artist who, I was told, was always on the prowl found out I was a writer and asked me to help him craft a text message to a chick photographer on assignment for Vice in Stockholm. He had thick tortoiseshell glasses and whined with refinement. He assumed I was an art critic, as most everyone did when I introduced myself as a writer, and asked me about magazines.

“Have you ever written for Domus? No? But you’ve heard of Domus, right? What about Precept? Not that, either? Yeah, it’s weird, me neither, I hadn’t heard of them until recently. There are just all these magazines, and it’s weird, all of them profile me. And you’re, like, what are you, you know? Are you art magazines or fashion magazines or what, when you profile me?” He named more magazines. “Uovo. Texte zur Kunst. 032c, Bidoun, Monopol, mono.kultur. So many. Texte zur Kunst.”

Alix swooped in and delivered me onto a roof to smoke, though of course you could smoke inside too. She rolled her eyes and promised that there was more to the art scene here than naming magazines. There were, to be fair, some very fine artists. There was Omer, a gruff Israeli who made multichannel video installations; there was the pretty much just Danish guy who made a big deal about being Icelandic and had a dirigible hangar and eighty pretty assistants; there was Maxime, a French kid in his early twenties who shot the kind of harsh and tender photographs one might have seen on Nan Goldin’s Facebook page; and there was Ignacio, who’d spent ten years in an office job making private artworks out of thousand-cell Excel spreadsheets. However, with the exception of Maxime, who had to stay out late enough for his friends to start tattooing each other so he could take pictures of them to put online, the really good artists didn’t seem to go out that much.

“Let’s get out of here,” Alix said, and took me to Bar Drei, where we sat until seven o’clock in the morning. There was no art space in Berlin more interesting than Bar Drei, and it wasn’t an art space at all. It looked like a gallery that had dispensed with the pretext of art entirely in favor of the unimpeachable idea of charging money for the free drinks. It was a fishbowl on a lonely corner behind the Volksbühne and had no sign save a large “3” stenciled on the door. The bar itself was a triangle of black Formica countertop in the center of the room, its vertices rounded off, so sitting at it made you feel as though you were a member of some deliberative post-tribal council of the future. The walls to the street were enormous windows. Everyone went there after the openings, or, as you got smarter about things, you skipped the openings and went straight to Drei, which was like an opening but with chairs. That was all anybody wanted at an opening, anyway, were chairs. The only other furnishings at Drei were black spherical bulbs that hung on cords at even intervals over the bar, like soft interrogation lamps; they weren’t fixed to anything and the only thing that would get you kicked out was pendulating them. Drei hired mostly artists, both Americans and Germans, as bartenders, and part of their art practice—I assumed this had something to do with the art world’s recent infatuation with something called “relational aesthetics”—was never keeping precise tabs. At the end of the night there was always a tense but pleasurable negotiation about the matter of what to pay.
Drei, I came to see as I became part of it, had an astonishingly regular clientele. Berlin was a city where three quarters of the population couldn’t drag itself out of bed before noon, but if there was one place that made people reliable, it was Drei. It was safe to assume that on any given evening, between the closing of the openings and the opening of the clubs, most of the people I came to know would be there. Some people I knew I saw only there. I met David Levine at Drei; and Zhivago, a beefy and voluble half-Danish, half-Syrian installation artist who grew up between Sacramento, Paris, and Valletta, and spoke at least eight languages, all of them fluently, none of them natively; and Carson, the gentle czar of the international-art-expat scene, who ran a noncommercial space devoted to intersections of art and architecture, dressed in sheer and tasteful varieties of drapery, and was always off to Osaka or Cap d’Antibes or Istanbul for a biennial or panel; and the other David, who painted surgically enhanced women in oils with textbook anatomical precision and spent three hours each day at the gym and seven hours each night smoking; and the style bloggers; and the Norwegian video artists; and, a little while later, the younger guys with the Internet-based work. In the summer everyone sat around on the monument outside, the one to all the lost and forgotten monuments, and in the winter the smoke was so thick inside that nobody had to smoke at all.

*

But Bar Drei didn’t open until nine-thirty at night, which still left the matter of the daytime. As far as doing nothing was concerned, if you couldn’t be an artist, you could at least be Jewish; in a way all the Americans in Berlin were honorary Jews. (Many of them were actual Jews.) In the first quarter of the twentieth century the saying used to go that “every Berliner comes from Breslau,” from the shtetls of the Pale of Settlement. They also said that “the Jew comes from the East and has no time.” He was an avatar of restless commercial modernity. These days the Jew comes from the West and has more time than he knows what to do with. He is an avatar of restless noncommercial modernity. I got by in that first year by writing up cranky little dispatches for a Web-based Jewish magazine out of New York that allowed the Jewishness of my content to be glancing.

The main trouble, it seemed to me, was that American Jews and Germans felt as though they needed to say something to one another, but never quite knew what. My mom, a rabbi and a psychoanalyst, came to visit for my first Thanksgiving, and we toured the standard Jewish monuments and memorials. Her feeling about the monuments and the memorials, like her feelings about anything in general, was that it was important to keep the conversation going, that the only way toward healing is through talk. I told her that of course I tended to agree with her, but that the problem in Berlin was that the conversational partners just didn’t match up. It often felt as though Germans over a certain age—twenty-five, say—wanted something from you, some sign that everything had finally become okay. I mostly did think that everything had become okay, but I never felt entitled to say that. After all, I hadn’t any personal connection to the Holocaust. The people who could offer real forgiveness were dead, or they were dying.

The ubiquity of these conversational templates made it impossible to forget I was Jewish. In the States it was something I’d never thought much about, which had always struck my friends as strange. They assumed that I, as the son of two rabbis, would have a strong religious commitment. But my parents had been savvy enough to know that if they made a big deal out of observance, we’d certainly end up defecting; so—with the exception of weekly Shabbat dinners at home and High Holiday attendance and large annual seders—they left it up to us, which meant we’d ended up mostly like normal, suburban, disaffected cultural Jews. Our Jewishness meant Woody Allen and latkes, like anybody else’s.

But in Berlin this ambivalent patrimony was foisted upon you. It was immediately clear that Jews had a certain purchase in Berlin; as David Levine let me quote him in one of my first columns, “They really know how to torque it.” I decided at a certain point that I liked those Jews best who were a little interested in the Holocaust, who liked to talk a few minutes of Holocaust now and then, technical stuff, mostly. These were often academics, like my friend who was writing a dissertation about the few exiles who returned, against their wives’ protests, to help rebuild German universities after the war. But a healthy relationship to the Holocaust wasn’t the norm. Melodrama was easier, more cheaply satisfying, and it was one way to explain to yourself what you were doing in Germany: just existing there was an act of defiance and strength. Being a Jew in New York is a mark of some considerable banality, but being a Jew in Berlin makes you special. You have the Holocaust in your pocket, the run of a city you rightly deserve.

There was the feeling that the Holocaust got you off the hook, only furthering the idea that you were in Berlin to do just as you pleased, sleep with whomever you felt like, even if she had a boyfriend. It allowed you to be contemptuous of the Germans, gave you an excuse to ignore the local culture. Or you could be obsequious, make a big deal out of how little you cared about the Holocaust, how much you despised the “Shoah industry,” how awful the histrionics of Libeskind. Jews like this were ambassadors; they found it in themselves to congratulate the Germans for having gotten over the past, which often—counterintuitively—meant congratulating themselves for having overcome their own fraught Jewish-American identity. It was a gesture of forgiveness that had everything to do with the forgiver and little to do with the forgiven. It was forgiveness as power, as arrogance.

This was all true, in an inverse way, about the Germans too. They reveled in their powerlessness. For them simply not being a Nazi counted as an accomplishment. For decades they had done really fine work not being Nazis—unlike the Austrians, who were still basically Nazis. The Germans had made not being Nazis into a central plank of their identity, and, as with the Jews, that meant they could be absolved of other ambitions.

As uncomfortable as it made me, it was often easiest just to give in to the sense of Holocaust-related entitlement. Sometimes this took the form of standard guilt. When the synagogue in the Rykestraße reopened to great fanfare, I felt I had to go at least hear Kol Nidre, and I did, though I left after fifteen minutes. Other times it took odder forms, like the habit I developed of walking around listening to Paul Célan read “Todesfuge” on my iPod. But most of the time these feelings were desublimated, more crassly manifested. At a birthday party for an Icelandic artist a young and beautiful German Goth reclined in a bathtub. The bathtub was in the kitchen; it pulled down from a closet between the sink and the stove, like a Murphy bed. She lolled against the dry porcelain and told me she’d just finished her degree in   Anti-Semitism Studies, with a focus on the post-Shoah relationship between West Germany and Israel. My friend Max was tall and handsome and obviously Jewish and made a habit of this sort of thing, and I pulled him aside to ask for the encouraging advice I knew he’d give. “The only way we—Germans and Jews alike—will heal these old wounds,” he said, “is if we take seriously our duty, difficult as it may often be, to take women like that home.”

The person who pulled off the bohemian thing most convincingly—that is, neither self-consciously nor apologetically—was Emilie, which was funny, because Emilie was also the only one of us who had an actual job—in fact, a whole series of them. The rest of us had come to Berlin to escape the authority of work, but Emilie hustled. She was always on the phone, screaming at someone in German customs to free up a six-foot carved totem from Uttar Pradesh in time for an opening that night; or running a gallery while her boss languished in Moabit Prison on charges of fraud (later acquitted); or curating a genuinely good group show in a former brewery, featuring work by some of our friends and later written up on the style-and-art-blog circuit by other of our friends. But she also managed to party as though it were her job. She worked harder than anybody I knew.

Emilie’s life may have been in a constant state of crisis, but it was never an existential crisis. They were practical crises. Some of them might have landed her in bureaucratic labyrinths or trapped her on Baltic islands with street-art-dealing aristocrats, but none of them ever seemed to make her wonder why she was in Berlin, which was something she could be specific about: she sold art. One of the nice things about Berlin was that you didn’t have to be specific if you didn’t feel like it. If somebody asked you what you were up to in town, you could say you were an artist or just interested in art and leave it at that. They didn’t need to know anything more, didn’t have to worry you were withholding anything, because in part what you were communicating was that you probably weren’t a hundred percent sure what you were doing there. But your erstwhile interrogator almost certainly wasn’t sure what she was doing there, either, so everybody could get away with being broad-brush about things. This obtained in general. Part of the liberation of Berlin in Berlin was the permission to be vague.

Emilie was different, though. She was good at the specific thing she did during the day, knew the right ways to talk to artists and collectors. She paid taxes, had been audited, had an expensive couch she tried not to get too many cigarette holes in. She was also loyal, and loyal in a way nobody in Berlin ever seemed to try very hard to be. She had principles, made a point of never sleeping with anybody her friends had slept with, and never cheated. Rarely cheated. All of these things were of a piece. The rest of us, at a certain point, began to worry that we were going out too much, felt mildly concerned that we were somehow betraying our true selves by not feeling held to account, not getting enough done—enough of what done we could rarely say—but Emilie never had that problem. She got done during the day what she had to get done and she did at night what she wanted to do. She was comfortable with her desire for some things because she was obligated to do others; she was able to oblige some things because she desired others. She bore the same relationship to us that Micah bore to the friends he had in Shanghai—shortly after I abandoned him he put in for a transfer overseas—who were always arguing about whose Mandarin had the best tones. Micah just went to the factory in Suzhou or Zhuhai or Taiyuan and got on with it.
Emilie, so confident about how she spent her time, was the closest thing we had to a true doyenne, and she could have posted up at Bar Drei with the rest of us. But she was cut out for demimonde grandeur, and was delighted to include anybody who wanted in. For a while Emilie dated an endearingly feckless East German named Kevin, a sweet case study in the most extreme psychological effects of the nanny state. Kevin was notionally a DJ, but sometimes he was so busy partying, he would forget to play music; when he remembered, though, everybody had a good time, and even when he forgot, it was okay. At the beginning we’d hang out in his studio—he was also, notionally, a photographer—and he’d spin records. He and his studio-mate called the place the Bernsteinzimmer, the “Amber Room,” after the alleged hoard of still-missing Nazi gold. His DJ name was Kevin9/11 until Emilie forced him to change it. Then he called himself Kevolution. Emilie sighed and gave up.

They had a pretty good relationship for a while, one mostly based on mutual respect for the intensity with which the other could party. Their terms of endearment were party related. “Du bist die Partymäuschen,” they would say with affectionate accuracy. “You are the little party mouse.”

At four-thirty one December weekday morning, at the close of what felt like my first semester in Berlin, we left Kevolution behind at the Bernsteinzimmer to play or not play records as he continued to see fit. It was Alix’s birthday and we were near the Prenzlauer Berg–Pankow border. Emilie had heard about a new club, and six or ten of us were wandering around in the chilly dark looking for it. As we walked past one of the entrances to the Mauerpark, a disputably green zone where a strip of no-man’s-land once was, she noticed a single votive candle on a sidewalk. She swerved into the black lane. Someone asked where she thought she was going.
“There’s a party in here,” she said, gesturing ahead of us into the dark. Someone asked how she knew.

“Did you not see the votive candle? Whenever you see votive candles, you follow them, and they take you to a rave.” We followed the votive candles a kilometer into the park. The tree branches stitched a starless canopy against the black sky. Somebody picked his or her way along in heels. We tried to turn back.

“Do whatever you like,” Emilie said, “but I’m going to this party.”

“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and shivered.

We walked for twenty more minutes, rounded a corner, and came through a copse to a Weimar-era toolshed. Inside there was a spectacular rave, with several rooms of music, an enormous amount of barely nibbled Turkish Fladenbrot, hundreds of people.
“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and we went to dance. We left Emilie there at eight thirty in the morning and took the M10 tram in a wide arc back to our side of town. The streets were just beginning to steep in the squalid sub-lactic half-light of a winter Thursday. Commuters read nationalist tabloids of anti-immigrant sentiment. Alix folded herself under my arm and fell asleep, I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, and life to me felt almost unbearably full.

There was some pretense, in Berlin, of sexual adventure as part of the never-ending audition in recklessness. A close friend, Jordan, complained that his cohort, all the pretty young ubiquitous art boys, had developed an orgy habit, and that he wanted no part in it. He was conservative, he said, and did not like to sleep with his friends; he just wanted a monogamous relationship with a nice man. He was twenty-three and modeled part-time; he spoke seven or eight languages, including Arabic and Polish and Japanese, and I was constantly telling him to quit his gallery job and get into a linguistics PhD program, where he belonged.

Jordan seemed to have healthy, unconflicted relationship to his sexuality, and we spent a lot of time talking about my dad. I told him that the main thing that had changed since my father came out was the innuendo. Actually, “innuendo” isn’t the right word, as it implies subtlety. There are many things for which you, or, more specifically, I, could reasonably blame my dad—deceit, say, or the sustained fantasy that a decade of complete and utter irresponsibility was the least the world owed him—but subtlety, especially about sex, is not one of them.

When I was a kid, there had been signs—mostly in his flickering moods—that he had another life. After he came out, everything was explicit. When I was in my early and mid-twenties, during the periods in which we were talking to each other, I would come through New York and we would meet for dinner or a drink in Chelsea. We would walk past a bar with blacked-out windows and a studded leathery stegosaural bouncer and he would roll his eyes and say something like, “Oh, God, the Rawhide. You really gotta keep your back to the wall in there.”

These stories made good anecdotes to trot out for my friends and girlfriends. They worked because they relied on the idea that I might have been expected to feel bad but instead took in the whole thing with detached amusement. My wacky gay-rabbi dad and his crude hijinks, I would imply, as if I were starring in the most progressive of sitcoms. I did not experience detached amusement. The innuendo always felt to me like bragging—bragging about the open eroticism of the life he led now, in contrast to his old, straitjacketed existence at home. This was, to some extent, the transparency I’d always wanted from him, but now it only made me feel lonely.

In turn I made a big deal about my endurance. The first time he took me to a gay bar, a New Jersey mansion dive in teak paneling and threadbare velour with the characteristically unimaginative gay-bar name of the Raven, I asked for a beer, he bought me a Cosmo, and then he walked off to greet some friends he and Brett had met at a club in Fort Lauderdale. I stood in the corner and sipped my Cosmo—I figured he was watching out for my carb intake—and did my best to avoid eye contact with what I was later told were called trolls. The next morning I called my then girlfriend, the one I’d hung around in San Francisco for, to complain about how exposed I’d felt under so much perverse late-middle-aged male scrutiny.

“Welcome,” she said, “to what it’s like to be a woman every single day.” I told that story for years, and the moral I made of her punch line was that everybody feels vulnerable sometimes and you ought to just get over yourself. In Berlin I went to gay bars all the time—which wasn’t hard, as in Berlin even the convenience stores often felt like de facto gay bars—to prove that I’d gotten over myself. For me this was the point of my dad’s Rawhide references: Get over yourself.

When I talked to Jordan about this, I was both looking for sympathy and trying to needle him; I was in part proud of my dad’s candor, his ability to be so unashamed of his desire, his apparent lack of hang-ups. “Jordan,” I said, “aren’t you selling out the revolutionary promise of homosexuality? What about the idea that the ethics of sexual loyalty is a hetero hang-up your kind has gloriously overcome in favor of the ethics of betrayal?” What about Genet—what about his sense that the traditional monogamous relationship was “something of a protection racket,” as Adam Phillips put it in a review of an Edmund White memoir. I promise to pretend as though you’re the only thing that could possibly make me happy, it says, and you promise the same thing, and we’ll surely make each other miserable. Genet’s counterproposal on behalf of his generation of homosexuals? An intimacy of anonymity. His idea, Phillips writes, was that “so-called relationships were the place where one needn’t take anything personally.”

Jordan was unfazed. “You just say that because you only fuck girls with boyfriends and you want to find some intellectual reason to think that’s okay, and because you know you yourself are dying for exactly that protection racket. You can’t stop looking for the perfect girl. Anyway, as far as gay people my age are concerned, what you’re talking about is the big problem with what your dad’s generation did to our generation. They grew up trying to be straight, so when they could finally fuck men, they went all crazy about it, and they still can’t stop fucking, and they’ve saddled us with the idea that gay life should always be this creepy free-for-all of fucking. But I’ve been gay since I knew how to talk, and all I want is my boyfriend and my dog, Miss Tilly, and a nice duvet and some DVDs. If you want to call that a protection racket, go right ahead, doll face. It’s what I want.”

But there was still a part of me that felt as though I had to grow up and into the ethics of betrayal, that part of coming to Berlin was getting over petty jealousy and the childish desire for an impossibly complete presence, and what felt so terrible so often wasn’t the old sadness and jealousy but the guilt about still being hung up in the same old ways.

The only artist who made work that seemed to address, in a serious and useful way, what was going on in Berlin—the absence of authority, the tyranny of desire—was David Levine. David was tall and muscular and perpetually stubbled, his jaundiced eyes open wide in frequent disbelief, and he spoke with a dark, feathery rasp. In summer he wore frayed wifebeaters and in winter thermal undershirts and motorcycle boots with the ringed trusses clipped off. You could imagine him smoking while working out, smoking while swimming. We had friends in common in New York, as everybody else did, and he had impressive and successful ex-girlfriends.

David was an experimental theater director and conceptual artist who thought the two worlds had something to learn from each other. Performance art had given up on the idea of rehearsal because it thought that authenticity could only derive from spontaneity, from unself-consciousness, which could make a performance feel uncanny and novel. But the authenticity part is always a red herring, David used to say. Well-acted, well-directed, and well-rehearsed theater could be just as moving, or as alienating, as any given performance-art tantrum. If you rehearse, if you employ all the traditional techniques the theater uses to create credibility, and only then take away the scaffolding, you could perhaps make something that would split the difference. Art doesn’t want to be seen as trying very hard, but the trick of the theater is that sometimes it’s only when you’re trying as hard as you possibly can that you seem effortless. David practiced forms of ritualized improvisation, or improvised ritual.

His first really big piece—called Bauerntheater, it had been written up at great length in the “Arts & Leisure” section of the Times—closed shortly before I arrived in town. He’d rehearsed an actor in the role of a potato farmer in a previously untranslated Heiner Müller play about East German agricultural collectivization in the fifties, then put the guy in a field about an hour outside of Berlin and had him plant potatoes in full costume in the regional style of the day. He’d gotten a large grant from the German cultural ministry to do this, and it had gotten him a lot of good press. An arts journalist friend of his wrote yet another thing about Berlin artists for a Manhattan magazine, and the big pull-quote was David’s. It concerned the differences between being an artist in Berlin and New York. “In New York,” he said, “if you’re not making a hundred grand and sleeping with a lesbian, you’re nothing.”

At Bar Drei one night after the story came out, he seemed distracted and I asked him why. “I’m worried,” he said, “that the story is going to piss off the lesbian I sleep with when I’m in New York.”

Alix put her cigarette out. “And I wonder if it’ll also piss off the German cultural ministry that made Bauerntheater possible by giving you a hundred grand.”

David Levine’s next project after Bauerntheater, the first one I was around for, was called The Gallery Will Be Relocating over the Summer. It was a fake art opening that took its name from the fact that the real gallery that hosted it was supposed to be relocating over the summer. Then the gallerist had a kid with a young Spanish artist, starting posting about the Andalusian weather on Facebook, and was never heard from again. The fake opening was a final project for his students in a class he was teaching at the Freie Universität. Each student spent an entire semester studying the habits and affects of an art-world person—an artist, curator, gallerist—and showed up in character for the performance at the gallery, in the Brunnenstraße. All the newer galleries back then were in the Brunnenstrasse and they would coordinate their monthly openings in a way that turned the street into a block party. These were my favorite evenings of that first year—drinking free beer in the nine p.m. sunlight, parading around in the street, knowing that everybody you knew in the whole city was on that block and was going to an after-party where everyone was there and nobody ever left—though the art was rarely very accomplished. David liked to say that the Brunnenstraße was where everybody got a chance. He didn’t mean that cynically.
“The most important thing to remember,” he said to me through the smoke at Bar Drei the day before his fake show was set to real open, “is that every artist is always making the best art he or she possibly can. You can call it bad art, if you want, and most of it is bad the way most of anything is bad, but there’s no grace in impugning the motivations behind it.”

I felt greedy and often impatient for these lopsided moments with David, moments of instruction and clarifying tenderness and even the occasional reprimand. Over time I tried harder not to press him into a vigilance he was neither interested in nor prepared for, and I was eager for chances to reciprocate, to show him I was just as interested in friendship as I was in oversight. So I was happy when David asked Alix and me to write the fake press release for his fake show. We took the job very seriously, spent hours outside at the Turkish bakery working on it, but in the end our draft wasn’t all that distinguishable from the real press release.

The fake opening had fake-real art on the walls, inspired by the real art of the characters under study, and real free booze, and a nonnegotiable locked-door duration of four hours. At seven p.m. David bicycle-locked the front door of the gallery. The only person inside in character as herself was an arts reporter in town, a friend of a friend whom we’d introduced to David at Bar Drei. He’d invited her to appear in the piece as herself, and she was flattered. “You’re like Peter Falk in Wings of Desire!” I said. She frowned.

The real opening, i.e., the opening of David’s show, was in the courtyard outside, where we milled and drank the same free booze the fake people were real-drinking inside. Occasionally we looked in through the window to see what the fake attendees were up to. What they were up to looked largely the same as what we were up to, which was part of the point, but we were afraid that they were having a better time. After all, they had been licensed by hard work and careful direction to spend a few hours being different people, which meant they were drunkenly rolling around on the floor and wrecking the artwork and making the most of it. This made an even better point. We were ourselves at a real event, which meant our hearts weren’t in it, not the way theirs were. We were freer, but they were surer of their roles and we couldn’t help but look over our shoulders at them.

The night was warm and there were a lot of free drinks and the after-party sounded increasingly auspicious and it had been a while, I realized, since I’d had such a nice time out at yet another art function in Berlin. The doors to the fake opening were unlocked at eleven. The New York arts reporter playing herself came out and held up her BlackBerry. Someone we knew in New York, or someone some of us knew and others had heard of, had gotten three quarters of a million dollars for his novel, which apparently included whimsical drawings. This was somehow not surprising, that news of ambition and focus and whimsy-related success in New York had come via the one New York media reporter playing herself inside a well-directed fake art opening in Berlin. It was the real toad in the imaginary garden.

The real news from the fake opening had seemed an ill omen. I’d been in Berlin for a year and had no better idea what I was doing there than I had when I arrived; the mere lifting of constraint had not infused my life with purpose, and I did not feel any freer than I had in San Francisco. I’d come to Berlin at least in part to escape what I saw as a kind of generational malaise, and had discovered there a slightly different kind of generational malaise. It had simply become a nonstop moral holiday, and we lived in it, and there was always someone in town from New York to show off for. This is an alternative to waiting in line for cupcakes, was the implication. Two friends visited and had a threesome with a tied-up Swede. Another friend came and cheated on her boyfriend with a twenty-one-year-old male model who was writing his undergraduate thesis on Heidegger. They came to see dawn and to cheat and we took them out and in the process allowed ourselves a great time we didn’t have to take full responsibility for. But as time went on we felt less and less great about it. We finished the night at seven in the morning, long after the sun had risen too early and too hot over the river at Bar25, at eight in the wintry morning coming out of Berghain long before the sun painted its gray on gray in the slushy sky, at ten in the morning at the Mauerpark flea market before you’ve been home to sleep, at eleven in the morning taking a regional train to a crummy Baltic beach to doze it off. The visitors were always ready to go home after an amazing week. It was their vacation but it was our life, and it no longer seemed like what I’d wanted. At that time there was a song lyric that did not stop running through my mind. “You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan / and the next five years trying to be with your friends again.” I wanted old friends and Micah and meaningful work and to sleep with a woman I was in love with and to wake up in the morning. I wanted the innocent life I’d had in San Francisco but this time having had the experiences I’d had in Berlin.

Even the spaces felt different to me. I no longer saw the aesthetic appeal of the postindustrial. We’d been pleased that the dilapidated buildings still stood, thought that the ruination—as opposed to Belle Époque elegance, or geometries of steel and glass—was a mark of our cold grit. But once things started to go bad, it seemed to me that we’d let the past persist merely to burlesque it. We sent up its quaint striving with athletic derangement. We kept the past around not for the sake of continuity but for the sake of rebuke. For a few months when I was out on my Middlemarch-avoiding walks I was drawn to the posters at bus stops asking for donations to shore up the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche. It had been built by the second kaiser in honor of the first one, and was mostly wrecked during the war. Since then it had been fastidiously maintained in its ruination, that it might stand as a warning. Every time it got too ruined, they had to beg the public for money to fix it up a little. It was a lot of effort to preserve an ideal state of decay. The effort involved seemed so pointless.

“I think I’m having a crisis,” I said to David as we walked to his after-party. I felt sheepish about casting him once more in the mentor role, especially on the night of his big success, but it was probably exactly that big success that made me feel I needed so much from him.

David fished a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it for me. “Of course you’re having a crisis. Look, everybody is having a crisis all of the time. You either feel like you’re too tied up and thus prevented from doing what you want to do, or you feel like you’re not tied up enough and have no idea what you want to do. The only thing that allows us any relief is what we tend to call purpose, or what I think about in terms of direction.”

You deal with the crisis that is life by obeying some authority you despise, the authority of money or the authority of relationships or grad school or the authority of cupcakes, and in that case you’re freaked out all the time because you feel like you’re always being thwarted, or you deal with it by renouncing all authority, and in that case you’re freaked out because you’re entirely thrown back upon yourself all of the time in a way pretty much nobody can handle. The main problem with desires, Berlin made clear, is that they’re not nearly as authoritative as we wish they were.

A sense of purpose allows for both the comfort of obedience and the dignity of autonomy. It represents relief from feeling servile and relief from having to worry at every moment about what, precisely, we think we might want right now, what costs we’re willing to pay. The question is: How can you find some structure that allows you to begin to understand what you want without forcing you to pay constant attention to the fluctuation of endlessly conflicting desires? And how can you realize that, whatever the situation, you’re probably already getting what you want on some level, whether you know it or not?

“Everybody is in a crisis all the time,” David finished, “and everybody, at the same time, under some sort of cover, is also pretty much doing what they want. Life is the crisis of doing what you want. Which means: Hold people accountable, but try to be understanding. Nobody gets off the hook just because they’re in a crisis, but you can have sympathy for them as they hang on it. The hook, I mean.” We reached the bar and he lit another cigarette.
Just before we entered the bar, he turned to me one last time.
“You are in a crisis, and you are also doing what you want.”

*

Eventually our crises began to resolve themselves, or maybe it was just that we’d grown bored of these particular crises and were ready for different ones. After one long week of inventive partying, Emilie called Kevolution from their apartment and asked when he would be home. It was ten to midnight on a Friday. “I’ll be home in twenty minutes,” Kevin said. He walked in at ten on Monday morning. Emilie threw her glass of orange juice at his head, narrowly missing an Alec Soth print worth ten thousand dollars, and asked where the fuck he’d been.

“Unterwegs,” he said. Under way.

Emilie broke up with him then, or maybe it was a little later, and Kevin was furious. He took back all he’d said before.  “Du bist nicht die Partymäuschen. Du bist ein Scheiß-Ami-Bitch.” It was cruel, but he knew he’d lost something good. She moved on to a guy with a job, a guy who could afford to go on actual vacations instead of trying to live in one.

Alix, for her part, was also moving on, going to graduate school in New York and some measure of stability and routine that, she feared, would drive her bonkers. She kept her place in Berlin, though, just in case. At the time I was happy for her and sad for myself. I’d thought I’d gotten used to the transience of the place, the constant new crashes and rescues that changed the demography of the shipwreck, but I hadn’t. At least not in her case.
Right around the time she was leaving they were closing the Building, some sort of artist-run space with wishy pedagogical ideas in the back basement of a supermarket wedged in between some East German tower blocks. For their final weekend of events, the people who ran the Building had invited their constituents to take an hour and do whatever they wished with it. Alix called her hour “The Event at the Building: Pedagogy as Potentiality in Reverse” and wrote a press release for it. It was to be listed as a lecture with a voguish description. The audience would file in and Alix would hand out boards and paper and charcoal and present a live model, and the people who expected a lecture on Rancière would have an hour of drawing from life.

Unfortunately for Alix, the Building’s press release, which Alix had long relied upon for its inanity, was in this case perversely clear: it went ahead and revealed the surprise. Alix tried to cancel the class, no longer saw a point, but her nude model was insistent. Alix wrote me a frustrated e-mail. “The model won’t not get naked. It’s part of her art practice, she says.” Until then nobody knew the nude art model had an art practice.

The nude model with the new art practice asked if I would document her nudity textually as part of a future project she was considering, on intimacy. Weren’t there going to be photographers there, I asked, not to mention a whole room of people drawing your nude figure? Yes, she said. But she wanted a text. Sort of like a live blog without the Internet.

I shouldn’t have been at all surprised, but by then I was so tired. Everything in the art world required extensive documentation. They didn’t believe in preparation, but they did believe in proof. I wondered then if the difference between people who believed in preparation and those who believed in proof, like the antagonism David described between those who believed in rehearsal and those who believed in spontaneity, wasn’t the difference between those who worked constantly for something that would endure and those who sought to capture something that occurred once. In Berlin photographs were taken of performances. Writers wrote about the photographs. Bloggers posted about the writers. Installation artists installed pieces about the bloggers.

Performance artists performed in the installations, hoping to get photographed. Photographers shot pictures of the bloggers, hoping to get in magazines. The Berlin Wall had existed primarily on television and in magazines. Berlin galleries existed primarily in Frieze and the social diary of Artforum.com.

Despite the confusion of the uncharacteristically lucid press release for the Event at the Building, most of the people were somehow surprised by the revelation that the fake lecture was going to be a real drawing class, which led one to believe that Alix was actually the only person reading these press releases in the first place. Everybody took it seriously. These were people who were very comfortable with their spectacular emancipation, but it had been years since they’d drawn from life, if they ever had. Everyone was quiet and absorbed and Alix shone like her crazy aunt Terry as she directed the changes in pose. She was immensely pleased.

At Bar Drei afterward we all felt clearer than we had in some time. David was inspired, and talked about his own version of a drawing class. He said he always thought about going back to actual theater directing, if he could do what he wanted. We ran out of cigarettes and walked out, past the Volksbühne, where he’d recently taken me to see Frank Castorf’s version of A Streetcar Named Desire. He called it Endstation Amerika—the Williams estate refused to let him use the name—and it lasted five hours. Kowalski was a grizzled Polish biker with roots in Solidarity. There was nudity and barbershop-quartet Britney Spears, and at one point Mitch forced Blanche to read off some stage directions from the supertitles. The actors may have been drunk. We’d both found it a shade too long.

“You know what the single most radical thing I could do in the Berlin theater would be?” David asked as he looked up at the stolid engaged columns of the Volksbühne. “I’d put on an old-fashioned naturalistic staging, in full period costume, of The Cherry Orchard.”

But pulling that off was going to take some time and a lot of preparation. The last show David put up while I still had an apartment in Berlin was called Hopefuls. It consisted of a few thousand headshots and cover letters seeking actor’s representation, which he plastered with hidden logic on his gallery’s walls. The point of all this was to represent the actor’s commitment to plasticity, to potential. One of the cover letters said that the actor had been told his range extended from Hayden Christensen to Halle Berry. This was because he was, he went on, “ethically dubious.” These were people campaigning vigorously for direction, and we needed to see them as gauche because we so acutely felt the same way. They were all doing the best they could to do something they cared about, and very few of them would succeed. We were doing as little as possible and pretended being in Berlin made us better than them. I stood in the room full of headshots and each one seemed to say, “I must change my life.”

We took out our frustrations on Berlin’s attempts to resemble New York. A lounge called Tausend opened up under the S-Bahn tracks near the Friedrichstraße station. Tausend means “thousand,” and it was not at all a Berlin name. A Berlin name would be “One” or “Two” or, at the very most, “Six.” Tausend also had a strict door policy, which was unusual. The night it opened David sent me a series of texts. “SHOCKINGLY NY 90S.” “I’M SITTING ON A GRAY FELT BANQUETTE.” “BLACK LEATHER CAR COATS OVER WHITE V-NECK T-SHIRTS, AND ONE PORK-PIE HAT.” “JAMIROQUAI.”

The whole point of Berlin was that there was nobody from college who worked in finance and asked if you rented or owned, nobody who blogged about media gossip, and no places like Tausend. Which meant that when a place like Tausend opened, it suggested that perhaps Berlin was over. But then Emilie would take us to the Damensalon, a former cosmetician’s in Neukölln with a bare interior, a plywood bar, and a vast sub-basement dance floor, and it was clear that nothing was over, that the very idea of a place being over, just like the very idea of a place being hip in the first place, was absurd. It had everything to do with the person saying it and nothing to do with the place itself.

What the word “over” really means is that your expectations of a place, your fantasies of who you might have become there, have been confounded by the persistence of you. You want a place to be strong enough to resist the patterns you force onto it, and there are places that can do that for a while. As it became increasingly clear that my era of inconsequence was not going to end in Berlin, as I’d anticipated, and as it had for Wenders’s angel, with the new taste of coffee—with, that is to say, the ability to feel as though what was in front of me was enough, the strength to sit alone in a room and not wonder what was going on in other, secret, more crowded rooms—I began to hope that it might end with Berlin. If moving to Berlin had not left me altered, alert and grateful and decisive, perhaps moving away would. Or perhaps just moving with direction would, waking up each day knowing I had committed myself to spending daylight walking as far as I could toward Santiago de Compostela. I didn’t actually care about what it meant to arrive there, or at least not the way a religious Catholic might. The word “pilgrim” comes from the Latin per agrum, “beyond the fields,” and for a long time in a lot of places it was pretty much the only pretext you had to leave home. I didn’t need a pretext to leave home, but I did want an excuse to have a series of structured days. I thought it might be a redemptive exercise in pointless direction, and I hoped in the end it might give me a better sense for where I stood.Embed"

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
You might also like[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Drop]
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs28Embed"

“Oh, that is nice of them!”

“You bet. I told you you'd like 'em. Squarest people on earth. Uh, Carrie——Would you mind if I sneaked down to the office for an hour, just to see how things are?”

“Why, no. Of course not. I know you're keen to get back to work.”

“Sure you don't mind?”

“Not a bit. Out of my way. Let me unpack.”

But the advocate of freedom in marriage was as much disappointed as a drooping bride at the alacrity with which he took that freedom and escaped to the world of men's affairs. Shе gazed about their bedroom, and its full dismalnеss crawled over her: the awkward knuckly L-shape of it; the black walnut bed with apples and spotty pears carved on the headboard; the imitation maple bureau, with pink-daubed scent-bottles and a petticoated pin-cushion on a marble slab uncomfortably like a gravestone; the plain pine washstand and the garlanded water-pitcher and bowl. The scent was of horsehair and plush and Florida Water.

“How could people ever live with things like this?” she shuddered. She saw the furniture as a circle of elderly judges, condemning her to death by smothering. The tottering brocade chair squeaked, “Choke her—choke her—smother her.” The old linen smelled of the tomb. She was alone in this house, this strange still house, among the shadows of dead thoughts and haunting repressions. “I hate it! I hate it!” she panted. “Why did I ever——”

She remembered that Kennicott's mother had brought these family relics from the old home in Lac-qui-Meurt. “Stop it! They're perfectly comfortable things. They're—comfortable. Besides——Oh, they're horrible! We'll change them, right away.”

Then, “But of course he HAS to see how things are at the office——”

She made a pretense of busying herself with unpacking. The chintz-lined, silver-fitted bag which had seemed so desirable a luxury in St. Paul was an extravagant vanity here. The daring black chemise of frail chiffon and lace was a hussy at which the deep-bosomed bed stiffened in disgust, and she hurled it into a bureau drawer, hid it beneath a sensible linen blouse.

She gave up unpacking. She went to the window, with a purely literary thought of village charm—hollyhocks and lanes and apple-cheeked cottagers. What she saw was the side of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—a plain clapboard wall of a sour liver color; the ash-pile back of the church; an unpainted stable; and an alley in which a Ford delivery-wagon had been stranded. This was the terraced garden below her boudoir; this was to be her scenery for——

“I mustn't! I mustn't! I'm nervous this afternoon. Am I sick? . . . Good Lord, I hope it isn't that! Not now! How people lie! How these stories lie! They say the bride is always so blushing and proud and happy when she finds that out, but—I'd hate it! I'd be scared to death! Some day but——Please, dear nebulous Lord, not now! Bearded sniffy old men sitting and demanding that we bear children. If THEY had to bear them——! I wish they did have to! Not now! Not till I've got hold of this job of liking the ash-pile out there! . . . I must shut up. I'm mildly insane. I'm going out for a walk. I'll see the town by myself. My first view of the empire I'm going to conquer!”
She fled from the house.

She stared with seriousness at every concrete crossing, every hitching-post, every rake for leaves; and to each house she devoted all her speculation. What would they come to mean? How would they look six months from now? In which of them would she be dining? Which of these people whom she passed, now mere arrangements of hair and clothes, would turn into intimates, loved or dreaded, different from all the other people in the world?

As she came into the small business-section she inspected a broad-beamed grocer in an alpaca coat who was bending over the apples and celery on a slanted platform in front of his store. Would she ever talk to him? What would he say if she stopped and stated, “I am Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. Some day I hope to confide that a heap of extremely dubious pumpkins as a window-display doesn't exhilarate me much.”

(The grocer was Mr. Frederick F. Ludelmeyer, whose market is at the corner of Main Street and Lincoln Avenue. In supposing that only she was observant Carol was ignorant, misled by the indifference of cities. She fancied that she was slipping through the streets invisible; but when she had passed, Mr. Ludelmeyer puffed into the store and coughed at his clerk, “I seen a young woman, she come along the side street. I bet she iss Doc Kennicott's new bride, good-looker, nice legs, but she wore a hell of a plain suit, no style, I wonder will she pay cash, I bet she goes to Howland & Gould's more as she does here, what you done with the poster for Fluffed Oats?”)

II

When Carol had walked for thirty-two minutes she had completely covered the town, east and west, north and south; and she stood at the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue and despaired.

Main Street with its two-story brick shops, its story-and-a-half wooden residences, its muddy expanse from concrete walk to walk, its huddle of Fords and lumber-wagons, was too small to absorb her. The broad, straight, unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie on every side. She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land. The skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away, at the north end of Main Street, was like the ribs of a dead cow. She thought of the coming of the Northern winter, when the unprotected houses would crouch together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste. They were so small and weak, the little brown houses. They were shelters for sparrows, not homes for warm laughing people.

She told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor. The maples were orange; the oaks a solid tint of raspberry. And the lawns had been nursed with love. But the thought would not hold. At best the trees resembled a thinned woodlot. There was no park to rest the eyes. And since not Gopher Prairie but Wakamin was the county-seat, there was no court-house with its grounds.

She glanced through the fly-specked windows of the most pretentious building in sight, the one place which welcomed strangers and determined their opinion of the charm and luxury of Gopher Prairie—the Minniemashie House. It was a tall lean shabby structure, three stories of yellow-streaked wood, the corners covered with sanded pine slabs purporting to symbolize stone. In the hotel office she could see a stretch of bare unclean floor, a line of rickety chairs with brass cuspidors between, a writing-desk with advertisements in mother-of-pearl letters upon the glass-covered back. The dining-room beyond was a jungle of stained table-cloths and catsup bottles.

She looked no more at the Minniemashie House.

A man in cuffless shirt-sleeves with pink arm-garters, wearing a linen collar but no tie, yawned his way from Dyer's Drug Store across to the hotel. He leaned against the wall, scratched a while, sighed, and in a bored way gossiped with a man tilted back in a chair. A lumber-wagon, its long green box filled with large spools of barbed-wire fencing, creaked down the block. A Ford, in reverse, sounded as though it were shaking to pieces, then recovered and rattled away. In the Greek candy-store was the whine of a peanut-roaster, and the oily smell of nuts.

There was no other sound nor sign of life.

She wanted to run, fleeing from the encroaching prairie, demanding the security of a great city. Her dreams of creating a beautiful town were ludicrous. Oozing out from every drab wall, she felt a forbidding spirit which she could never conquer.
She trailed down the street on one side, back on the other, glancing into the cross streets. It was a private Seeing Main Street tour. She was within ten minutes beholding not only the heart of a place called Gopher Prairie, but ten thousand towns from Albany to San Diego:

Dyer's Drug Store, a corner building of regular and unreal blocks of artificial stone. Inside the store, a greasy marble soda-fountain with an electric lamp of red and green and curdled-yellow mosaic shade. Pawed-over heaps of tooth-brushes and combs and packages of shaving-soap. Shelves of soap-cartons, teething-rings, garden-seeds, and patent medicines in yellow “packages-nostrums” for consumption, for “women's diseases”—notorious mixtures of opium and alcohol, in the very shop to which her husband sent patients for the filling of prescriptions.

From a second-story window the sign “W. P. Kennicott, Phys. & Surgeon,” gilt on black sand.

A small wooden motion-picture theater called “The Rosebud Movie Palace.” Lithographs announcing a film called “Fatty in Love.”

Howland & Gould's Grocery. In the display window, black, overripe bananas and lettuce on which a cat was sleeping. Shelves lined with red crepe paper which was now faded and torn and concentrically spotted. Flat against the wall of the second story the signs of lodges—the Knights of Pythias, the Maccabees, the Woodmen, the Masons.

Dahl & Oleson's Meat Market—a reek of blood.

A jewelry shop with tinny-looking wrist-watches for women. In front of it, at the curb, a huge wooden clock which did not go.

A fly-buzzing saloon with a brilliant gold and enamel whisky sign across the front. Other saloons down the block. From them a stink of stale beer, and thick voices bellowing pidgin German or trolling out dirty songs—vice gone feeble and unenterprising and dull—the delicacy of a mining-camp minus its vigor. In front of the saloons, farmwives sitting on the seats of wagons, waiting for their husbands to become drunk and ready to start home.

A tobacco shop called “The Smoke House,” filled with young men shaking dice for cigarettes. Racks of magazines, and pictures of coy fat prostitutes in striped bathing-suits.

A clothing store with a display of “ox-blood-shade Oxfords with bull-dog toes.” Suits which looked worn and glossless while they were still new, flabbily draped on dummies like corpses with painted cheeks.

The Bon Ton Store—Haydock & Simons'—the largest shop in town. The first-story front of clear glass, the plates cleverly bound at the edges with brass. The second story of pleasant tapestry brick. One window of excellent clothes for men, interspersed with collars of floral pique which showed mauve daisies on a saffron ground. Newness and an obvious notion of neatness and service. Haydock & Simons. Haydock. She had met a Haydock at the station; Harry Haydock; an active person of thirty-five. He seemed great to her, now, and very like a saint. His shop was clean!

Axel Egge's General Store, frequented by Scandinavian farmers. In the shallow dark window-space heaps of sleazy sateens, badly woven galateas, canvas shoes designed for women with bulging ankles, steel and red glass buttons upon cards with broken edges, a cottony blanket, a granite-ware frying-pan reposing on a sun-faded crepe blouse.

Sam Clark's Hardware Store. An air of frankly metallic enterprise. Guns and churns and barrels of nails and beautiful shiny butcher knives.
Chester Dashaway's House Furnishing Emporium. A vista of heavy oak rockers with leather seats, asleep in a dismal row.

Billy's Lunch. Thick handleless cups on the wet oilcloth-covered counter. An odor of onions and the smoke of hot lard. In the doorway a young man audibly sucking a toothpick.

The warehouse of the buyer of cream and potatoes. The sour smell of a dairy.

The Ford Garage and the Buick Garage, competent one-story brick and cement buildings opposite each other. Old and new cars on grease-blackened concrete floors. Tire advertisements. The roaring of a tested motor; a racket which beat at the nerves. Surly young men in khaki union-overalls. The most energetic and vital places in town.

A large warehouse for agricultural implements. An impressive barricade of green and gold wheels, of shafts and sulky seats, belonging to machinery of which Carol knew nothing—potato-planters, manure-spreaders, silage-cutters, disk-harrows, breaking-plows.

A feed store, its windows opaque with the dust of bran, a patent medicine advertisement painted on its roof.

Ye Art Shoppe, Prop. Mrs. Mary Ellen Wilks, Christian Science Library open daily free. A touching fumble at beauty. A one-room shanty of boards recently covered with rough stucco. A show-window delicately rich in error: vases starting out to imitate tree-trunks but running off into blobs of gilt—an aluminum ash-tray labeled “Greetings from Gopher Prairie”—a Christian Science magazine—a stamped sofa-cushion portraying a large ribbon tied to a small poppy, the correct skeins of embroidery-silk lying on the pillow. Inside the shop, a glimpse of bad carbon prints of bad and famous pictures, shelves of phonograph records and camera films, wooden toys, and in the midst an anxious small woman sitting in a padded rocking chair.

A barber shop and pool room. A man in shirt sleeves, presumably Del Snafflin the proprietor, shaving a man who had a large Adam's apple.

Nat Hicks's Tailor Shop, on a side street off Main. A one-story building. A fashion-plate showing human pitchforks in garments which looked as hard as steel plate.

On another side street a raw red-brick Catholic Church with a varnished yellow door.

The post-office—merely a partition of glass and brass shutting off the rear of a mildewed room which must once have been a shop. A tilted writing-shelf against a wall rubbed black and scattered with official notices and army recruiting-posters.

The damp, yellow-brick schoolbuilding in its cindery grounds.

The State Bank, stucco masking wood.

The Farmers' National Bank. An Ionic temple of marble. Pure, exquisite, solitary. A brass plate with “Ezra Stowbody, Pres't.”

A score of similar shops and establishments.

Behind them and mixed with them, the houses, meek cottages or large, comfortable, soundly uninteresting symbols of prosperity.

In all the town not one building save the Ionic bank which gave pleasure to Carol's eyes; not a dozen buildings which suggested that, in the fifty years of Gopher Prairie's existence, the citizens had realized that it was either desirable or possible to make this, their common home, amusing or attractive.

It was not only the unsparing unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her. It was the planlessness, the flimsy temporariness of the buildings, their faded unpleasant colors. The street was cluttered with electric-light poles, telephone poles, gasoline pumps for motor cars, boxes of goods. Each man had built with the most valiant disregard of all the others. Between a large new “block” of two-story brick shops on one side, and the fire-brick Overland garage on the other side, was a one-story cottage turned into a millinery shop. The white temple of the Farmers' Bank was elbowed back by a grocery of glaring yellow brick. One store-building had a patchy galvanized iron cornice; the building beside it was crowned with battlements and pyramids of brick capped with blocks of red sandstone.

She escaped from Main Street, fled home.

She wouldn't have cared, she insisted, if the people had been comely. She had noted a young man loafing before a shop, one unwashed hand holding the cord of an awning; a middle-aged man who had a way of staring at women as though he had been married too long and too prosaically; an old farmer, solid, wholesome, but not clean—his face like a potato fresh from the earth. None of them had shaved for three days.

“If they can't build shrines, out here on the prairie, surely there's nothing to prevent their buying safety-razors!” she raged.

She fought herself: “I must be wrong. People do live here. It CAN'T be as ugly as—as I know it is! I must be wrong. But I can't do it. I can't go through with it.”

She came home too seriously worried for hysteria; and when she found Kennicott waiting for her, and exulting, “Have a walk? Well, like the town? Great lawns and trees, eh?” she was able to say, with a self-protective maturity new to her, “It's very interesting.”

The train which brought Carol to Gopher Prairie also brought Miss Bea Sorenson.

Miss Bea was a stalwart, corn-colored, laughing young woman, and she was bored by farm-work. She desired the excitements of city-life, and the way to enjoy city-life was, she had decided, to “go get a yob as hired girl in Gopher Prairie.” She contentedly lugged her pasteboard telescope from the station to her cousin, Tina Malmquist, maid of all work in the residence of Mrs. Luke Dawson.

“Vell, so you come to town,” said Tina.

“Ya. Ay get a yob,” said Bea.

“Vell. . . . You got a fella now?”

“Ya. Yim Yacobson.”

“Vell. I'm glat to see you. How much you vant a veek?”

“Sex dollar.”

“There ain't nobody pay dat. Vait! Dr. Kennicott, I t'ink he marry a girl from de Cities. Maybe she pay dat. Vell. You go take a valk.”

“Ya,” said Bea.

So it chanced that Carol Kennicott and Bea Sorenson were viewing Main Street at the same time.

Bea had never before been in a town larger than Scandia Crossing, which has sixty-seven inhabitants.

As she marched up the street she was meditating that it didn't hardly seem like it was possible there could be so many folks all in one place at the same time. My! It would take years to get acquainted with them all. And swell people, too! A fine big gentleman in a new pink shirt with a diamond, and not no washed-out blue denim working-shirt. A lovely lady in a longery dress (but it must be an awful hard dress to wash). And the stores!

Not just three of them, like there were at Scandia Crossing, but more than four whole blocks!

The Bon Ton Store—big as four barns—my! it would simply scare a person to go in there, with seven or eight clerks all looking at you. And the men's suits, on figures just like human. And Axel Egge's, like home, lots of Swedes and Norskes in there, and a card of dandy buttons, like rubies.

A drug store with a soda fountain that was just huge, awful long, and all lovely marble; and on it there was a great big lamp with the biggest shade you ever saw—all different kinds colored glass stuck together; and the soda spouts, they were silver, and they came right out of the bottom of the lamp-stand! Behind the fountain there were glass shelves, and bottles of new kinds of soft drinks, that nobody ever heard of. Suppose a fella took you THERE!

A hotel, awful high, higher than Oscar Tollefson's new red barn; three stories, one right on top of another; you had to stick your head back to look clear up to the top. There was a swell traveling man in there—probably been to Chicago, lots of times.

Oh, the dandiest people to know here! There was a lady going by, you wouldn't hardly say she was any older than Bea herself; she wore a dandy new gray suit and black pumps. She almost looked like she was looking over the town, too. But you couldn't tell what she thought. Bea would like to be that way—kind of quiet, so nobody would get fresh. Kind of—oh, elegant.

A Lutheran Church. Here in the city there'd be lovely sermons, and church twice on Sunday, EVERY Sunday!

And a movie show!

A regular theater, just for movies. With the sign “Change of bill every evening.” Pictures every evening!

There were movies in Scandia Crossing, but only once every two weeks, and it took the Sorensons an hour to drive in—papa was such a tightwad he wouldn't get a Ford. But here she could put on her hat any evening, and in three minutes' walk be to the movies, and see lovely fellows in dress-suits and Bill Hart and everything!

How could they have so many stores? Why! There was one just for tobacco alone, and one (a lovely one—the Art Shoppy it was) for pictures and vases and stuff, with oh, the dandiest vase made so it looked just like a tree trunk!

Bea stood on the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue. The roar of the city began to frighten her. There were five automobiles on the street all at the same time—and one of 'em was a great big car that must of cost two thousand dollars—and the 'bus was starting for a train with five elegant-dressed fellows, and a man was pasting up red bills with lovely pictures of washing-machines on them, and the jeweler was laying out bracelets and wrist-watches and EVERYTHING on real velvet.

What did she care if she got six dollars a week? Or two! It was worth while working for nothing, to be allowed to stay here. And think how it would be in the evening, all lighted up—and not with no lamps, but with electrics! And maybe a gentleman friend taking you to the movies and buying you a strawberry ice cream soda!

Bea trudged back.

“Vell? You lak it?” said Tina.

“Ya. Ay lak it. Ay t'ink maybe Ay stay here,” said Bea.

IV

The recently built house of Sam Clark, in which was given the party to welcome Carol, was one of the largest in Gopher Prairie. It had a clean sweep of clapboards, a solid squareness, a small tower, and a large screened porch. Inside, it was as shiny, as hard, and as cheerful as a new oak upright piano.

Carol looked imploringly at Sam Clark as he rolled to the door and shouted, “Welcome, little lady! The keys of the city are yourn!”

Beyond him, in the hallway and the living-room, sitting in a vast prim circle as though they were attending a funeral, she saw the guests. They were WAITING so! They were waiting for her! The determination to be all one pretty flowerlet of appreciation leaked away. She begged of Sam, “I don't dare face them! They expect so much. They'll swallow me in one mouthful—glump!—like that!”

“Why, sister, they're going to love you—same as I would if I didn't think the doc here would beat me up!”

“B-but——I don't dare! Faces to the right of me, faces in front of me, volley and wonder!”

She sounded hysterical to herself; she fancied that to Sam Clark she sounded insane. But he chuckled, “Now you just cuddle under Sam's wing, and if anybody rubbers at you too long, I'll shoo 'em off. Here we go! Watch my smoke—Sam'l, the ladies' delight and the bridegrooms' terror!”

His arm about her, he led her in and bawled, “Ladies and worser halves, the bride! We won't introduce her round yet, because she'll never get your bum names straight anyway. Now bust up this star-chamber!”

They tittered politely, but they did not move from the social security of their circle, and they did not cease staring.

Carol had given creative energy to dressing for the event. Her hair was demure, low on her forehead with a parting and a coiled braid. Now she wished that she had piled it high. Her frock was an ingenue slip of lawn, with a wide gold sash and a low square neck, which gave a suggestion of throat and molded shoulders. But as they looked her over she was certain that it was all wrong. She wished alternately that she had worn a spinsterish high-necked dress, and that she had dared to shock them with a violent brick-red scarf which she had bought in Chicago.

She was led about the circle. Her voice mechanically produced safe remarks:

“Oh, I'm sure I'm going to like it here ever so much,” and “Yes, we did have the best time in Colorado—mountains,” and “Yes, I lived in St. Paul several years. Euclid P. Tinker? No, I don't REMEMBER meeting him, but I'm pretty sure I've heard of him.”

Kennicott took her aside and whispered, “Now I'll introduce you to them, one at a time.”

“Tell me about them first.”

“Well, the nice-looking couple over there are Harry Haydock and his wife, Juanita. Harry's dad owns most of the Bon Ton, but it's Harry who runs it and gives it the pep. He's a hustler. Next to him is Dave Dyer the druggist—you met him this afternoon—mighty good duck-shot. The tall husk beyond him is Jack Elder—Jackson Elder—owns the planing-mill, and the Minniemashie House, and quite a share in the Farmers' National Bank. Him and his wife are good sports—him and Sam and I go hunting together a lot. The old cheese there is Luke Dawson, the richest man in town. Next to him is Nat Hicks, the tailor.”

“Really? A tailor?”

“Sure. Why not? Maybe we're slow, but we are democratic. I go hunting with Nat same as I do with Jack Elder.”

“I'm glad. I've never met a tailor socially. It must be charming to meet one and not have to think about what you owe him. And do you——Would you go hunting with your barber, too?”

“No but——No use running this democracy thing into the ground. Besides, I've known Nat for years, and besides, he's a mighty good shot and——That's the way it is, see? Next to Nat is Chet Dashaway. Great fellow for chinning. He'll talk your arm off, about religion or politics or books or anything.”

Carol gazed with a polite approximation to interest at Mr. Dashaway, a tan person with a wide mouth. “Oh, I know! He's the furniture-store man!” She was much pleased with herself.

“Yump, and he's the undertaker. You'll like him. Come shake hands with him.”

“Oh no, no! He doesn't—he doesn't do the embalming and all that—himself? I couldn't shake hands with an undertaker!”

“Why not? You'd be proud to shake hands with a great surgeon, just after he'd been carving up people's bellies.”

She sought to regain her afternoon's calm of maturity. “Yes. You're right. I want—oh, my dear, do you know how much I want to like the people you like? I want to see people as they are.”

“Well, don't forget to see people as other folks see them as they are! They have the stuff. Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here? Born and brought up here!”

“Bresnahan?”

“Yes—you know—president of the Velvet Motor Company of Boston, Mass.—make the Velvet Twelve—biggest automobile factory in New England.”

“I think I've heard of him.”

“Sure you have. Why, he's a millionaire several times over! Well, Perce comes back here for the black-bass fishing almost every summer, and he says if he could get away from business, he'd rather live here than in Boston or New York or any of those places. HE doesn't mind Chet's undertaking.”

“Please! I'll—I'll like everybody! I'll be the community sunbeam!”

He led her to the Dawsons.

Luke Dawson, lender of money on mortgages, owner of Northern cut-over land, was a hesitant man in unpressed soft gray clothes, with bulging eyes in a milky face. His wife had bleached cheeks, bleached hair, bleached voice, and a bleached manner. She wore her expensive green frock, with its passementeried bosom, bead tassels, and gaps between the buttons down the back, as though she had bought it second-hand and was afraid of meeting the former owner. They were shy. It was “Professor” George Edwin Mott, superintendent of schools, a Chinese mandarin turned brown, who held Carol's hand and made her welcome.

When the Dawsons and Mr. Mott had stated that they were “pleased to meet her,” there seemed to be nothing else to say, but the conversation went on automatically.

“Do you like Gopher Prairie?” whimpered Mrs. Dawson.

“Oh, I'm sure I'm going to be ever so happy.”

“There's so many nice people.” Mrs. Dawson looked to Mr. Mott for social and intellectual aid. He lectured:

“There's a fine class of people. I don't like some of these retired farmers who come here to spend their last days—especially the Germans. They hate to pay school-taxes. They hate to spend a cent. But the rest are a fine class of people. Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here? Used to go to school right at the old building!”

“I heard he did.”

“Yes. He's a prince. He and I went fishing together, last time he was here.”

The Dawsons and Mr. Mott teetered upon weary feet, and smiled at Carol with crystallized expressions. She went on:

“Tell me, Mr. Mott: Have you ever tried any experiments with any of the new educational systems? The modern kindergarten methods or the Gary system?”

“Oh. Those. Most of these would-be reformers are simply notoriety-seekers. I believe in manual training, but Latin and mathematics always will be the backbone of sound Americanism, no matter what these faddists advocate—heaven knows what they do want—knitting, I suppose, and classes in wiggling the ears!”

The Dawsons smiled their appreciation of listening to a savant. Carol waited till Kennicott should rescue her. The rest of the party waited for the miracle of being amused.

Harry and Juanita Haydock, Rita Simons and Dr. Terry Gould—the young smart set of Gopher Prairie. She was led to them. Juanita Haydock flung at her in a high, cackling, friendly voice:

“Well, this is SO nice to have you here. We'll have some good parties—dances and everything. You'll have to join the Jolly Seventeen. We play bridge and we have a supper once a month. You play, of course?”

“N-no, I don't.”

“Really? In St. Paul?”

“I've always been such a book-worm.”

“We'll have to teach you. Bridge is half the fun of life.” Juanita had become patronizing, and she glanced disrespectfully at Carol's golden sash, which she had previously admired.

Harry Haydock said politely, “How do you think you're going to like the old burg?”

“I'm sure I shall like it tremendously.”

“Best people on earth here. Great hustlers, too. Course I've had lots of chances to go live in Minneapolis, but we like it here. Real he-town. Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here?”

Carol perceived that she had been weakened in the biological struggle by disclosing her lack of bridge. Roused to nervous desire to regain her position she turned on Dr. Terry Gould, the young and pool-playing competitor of her husband. Her eyes coquetted with him while she gushed:

“I'll learn bridge. But what I really love most is the outdoors. Can't we all get up a boating party, and fish, or whatever you do, and have a picnic supper afterwards?”

“Now you're talking!” Dr. Gould affirmed. He looked rather too obviously at the cream-smooth slope of her shoulder. “Like fishing? Fishing is my middle name. I'll teach you bridge. Like cards at all?”

“I used to be rather good at bezique.”

She knew that bezique was a game of cards—or a game of something else. Roulette, possibly. But her lie was a triumph. Juanita's handsome, high-colored, horsey face showed doubt. Harry stroked his nose and said humbly, “Bezique? Used to be great gambling game, wasn't it?”

While others drifted to her group, Carol snatched up the conversation. She laughed and was frivolous and rather brittle. She could not distinguish their eyes. They were a blurry theater-audience before which she self-consciously enacted the comedy of being the Clever Little Bride of Doc Kennicott:

“These-here celebrated Open Spaces, that's what I'm going out for. I'll never read anything but the sporting-page again. Will converted me on our Colorado trip. There were so many mousey tourists who were afraid to get out of the motor 'bus that I decided to be Annie Oakley, the Wild Western Wampire, and I bought oh! a vociferous skirt which revealed my perfectly nice ankles to the Presbyterian glare of all the Ioway schoolma'ams, and I leaped from peak to peak like the nimble chamoys, and——You may think that Herr Doctor Kennicott is a Nimrod, but you ought to have seen me daring him to strip to his B. V. D.'s and go swimming in an icy mountain brook.”

She knew that they were thinking of becoming shocked, but Juanita Haydock was admiring, at least. She swaggered on:

“I'm sure I'm going to ruin Will as a respectable practitioner——Is he a good doctor, Dr. Gould?”

Kennicott's rival gasped at this insult to professional ethics, and he took an appreciable second before he recovered his social manner. “I'll tell you, Mrs. Kennicott.” He smiled at Kennicott, to imply that whatever he might say in the stress of being witty was not to count against him in the commercio-medical warfare. “There's some people in town that say the doc is a fair to middlin' diagnostician and prescription-writer, but let me whisper this to you—but for heaven's sake don't tell him I said so—don't you ever go to him for anything more serious than a pendectomy of the left ear or a strabismus of the cardiograph.”

No one save Kennicott knew exactly what this meant, but they laughed, and Sam Clark's party assumed a glittering lemon-yellow color of brocade panels and champagne and tulle and crystal chandeliers and sporting duchesses. Carol saw that George Edwin Mott and the blanched Mr. and Mrs. Dawson were not yet hypnotized. They looked as though they wondered whether they ought to look as though they disapproved. She concentrated on them:

“But I know whom I wouldn't have dared to go to Colorado with! Mr. Dawson there! I'm sure he's a regular heart-breaker. When we were introduced he held my hand and squeezed it frightfully.”

“Haw! Haw! Haw!” The entire company applauded. Mr. Dawson was beatified. He had been called many things—loan-shark, skinflint, tightwad, pussyfoot—but he had never before been called a flirt.

“He is wicked, isn't he, Mrs. Dawson? Don't you have to lock him up?”

“Oh no, but maybe I better,” attempted Mrs. Dawson, a tint on her pallid face.

For fifteen minutes Carol kept it up. She asserted that she was going to stage a musical comedy, that she preferred cafe parfait to beefsteak, that she hoped Dr. Kennicott would never lose his ability to make love to charming women, and that she had a pair of gold stockings. They gaped for more. But she could not keep it up. She retired to a chair behind Sam Clark's bulk. The smile-wrinkles solemnly flattened out in the faces of all the other collaborators in having a party, and again they stood about hoping but not expecting to be amused.

Carol listened. She discovered that conversation did not exist in Gopher Prairie. Even at this affair, which brought out the young smart set, the hunting squire set, the respectable intellectual set, and the solid financial set, they sat up with gaiety as with a corpse.

Juanita Haydock talked a good deal in her rattling voice but it was invariably of personalities: the rumor that Raymie Wutherspoon was going to send for a pair of patent leather shoes with gray buttoned tops; the rheumatism of Champ Perry; the state of Guy Pollock's grippe; and the dementia of Jim Howland in painting his fence salmon-pink.

Sam Clark had been talking to Carol about motor cars, but he felt his duties as host. While he droned, his brows popped up and down. He interrupted himself, “Must stir 'em up.” He worried at his wife, “Don't you think I better stir 'em up?” He shouldered into the center of the room, and cried:

“Let's have some stunts, folks.”

“Yes, let's!” shrieked Juanita Haydock.

“Say, Dave, give us that stunt about the Norwegian catching a hen.”

“You bet; that's a slick stunt; do that, Dave!” cheered Chet Dashaway.

Mr. Dave Dyer obliged.

All the guests moved their lips in anticipation of being called on for their own stunts.

“Ella, come on and recite 'Old Sweetheart of Mine,' for us,” demanded Sam.

Miss Ella Stowbody, the spinster daughter of the Ionic bank, scratched her dry palms and blushed. “Oh, you don't want to hear that old thing again.”

“Sure we do! You bet!” asserted Sam.

“My voice is in terrible shape tonight.”

“Tut! Come on!”

Sam loudly explained to Carol, “Ella is our shark at elocuting. She's had professional training. She studied singing and oratory and dramatic art and shorthand for a year, in Milwaukee.”

Miss Stowbody was reciting. As encore to “An Old Sweetheart of Mine,” she gave a peculiarly optimistic poem regarding the value of smiles.

There were four other stunts: one Jewish, one Irish, one juvenile, and Nat Hicks's parody of Mark Antony's funeral oration.

During the winter Carol was to hear Dave Dyer's hen-catching impersonation seven times, “An Old Sweetheart of Mine” nine times, the Jewish story and the funeral oration twice; but now she was ardent and, because she did so want to be happy and simple-hearted, she was as disappointed as the others when the stunts were finished, and the party instantly sank back into coma.

They gave up trying to be festive; they began to talk naturally, as they did at their shops and homes.

The men and women divided, as they had been tending to do all evening. Carol was deserted by the men, left to a group of matrons who steadily pattered of children, sickness, and cooks—their own shop-talk. She was piqued. She remembered visions of herself as a smart married woman in a drawing-room, fencing with clever men. Her dejection was relieved by speculation as to what the men were discussing, in the corner between the piano and the phonograph. Did they rise from these housewifely personalities to a larger world of abstractions and affairs?

She made her best curtsy to Mrs. Dawson; she twittered, “I won't have my husband leaving me so soon! I'm going over and pull the wretch's ears.” She rose with a jeune fille bow. She was self-absorbed and self-approving because she had attained that quality of sentimentality. She proudly dipped across the room and, to the interest and commendation of all beholders, sat on the arm of Kennicott's chair.

He was gossiping with Sam Clark, Luke Dawson, Jackson Elder of the planing-mill, Chet Dashaway, Dave Dyer, Harry Haydock, and Ezra Stowbody, president of the Ionic bank.

Ezra Stowbody was a troglodyte. He had come to Gopher Prairie in 1865. He was a distinguished bird of prey—swooping thin nose, turtle mouth, thick brows, port-wine cheeks, floss of white hair, contemptuous eyes. He was not happy in the social changes of thirty years. Three decades ago, Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh the lawyer, Merriman Peedy the Congregational pastor and himself had been the arbiters. That was as it should be; the fine arts—medicine, law, religion, and finance—recognized as aristocratic; four Yankees democratically chatting with but ruling the Ohioans and Illini and Swedes and Germans who had ventured to follow them. But Westlake was old, almost retired; Julius Flickerbaugh had lost much of his practice to livelier attorneys; Reverend (not The Reverend) Peedy was dead; and nobody was impressed in this rotten age of automobiles by the “spanking grays” which Ezra still drove. The town was as heterogeneous as Chicago. Norwegians and Germans owned stores. The social leaders were common merchants. Selling nails was considered as sacred as banking. These upstarts—the Clarks, the Haydocks—had no dignity. They were sound and conservative in politics, but they talked about motor cars and pump-guns and heaven only knew what new-fangled fads. Mr. Stowbody felt out of place with them. But his brick house with the mansard roof was still the largest residence in town, and he held his position as squire by occasionally appearing among the younger men and reminding them by a wintry eye that without the banker none of them could carry on their vulgar businesses.

As Carol defied decency by sitting down with the men, Mr. Stowbody was piping to Mr. Dawson, “Say, Luke, when was't Biggins first settled in Winnebago Township? Wa'n't it in 1879?”

“Why no 'twa'n't!” Mr. Dawson was indignant. “He come out from Vermont in 1867—no, wait, in 1868, it must have been—and took a claim on the Rum River, quite a ways above Anoka.”

“He did not!” roared Mr. Stowbody. “He settled first in Blue Earth County, him and his father!”

(“What's the point at issue?”) Carol whispered to Kennicott.

(“Whether this old duck Biggins had an English setter or a Llewellyn. They've been arguing it all evening!”)

Dave Dyer interrupted to give tidings, “D' tell you that Clara Biggins was in town couple days ago? She bought a hot-water bottle—expensive one, too—two dollars and thirty cents!”

“Yaaaaaah!” snarled Mr. Stowbody. “Course. She's just like her grandad was. Never save a cent. Two dollars and twenty—thirty, was it?—two dollars and thirty cents for a hot-water bottle! Brick wrapped up in a flannel petticoat just as good, anyway!”

“How's Ella's tonsils, Mr. Stowbody?” yawned Chet Dashaway.

While Mr. Stowbody gave a somatic and psychic study of them, Carol reflected, “Are they really so terribly interested in Ella's tonsils, or even in Ella's esophagus? I wonder if I could get them away from personalities? Let's risk damnation and try.”

“There hasn't been much labor trouble around here, has there, Mr. Stowbody?” she asked innocently.

“No, ma'am, thank God, we've been free from that, except maybe with hired girls and farm-hands. Trouble enough with these foreign farmers; if you don't watch these Swedes they turn socialist or populist or some fool thing on you in a minute. Of course, if they have loans you can make 'em listen to reason. I just have 'em come into the bank for a talk, and tell 'em a few things. I don't mind their being democrats, so much, but I won't stand having socialists around. But thank God, we ain't got the labor trouble they have in these cities. Even Jack Elder here gets along pretty well, in the planing-mill, don't you, Jack?”

“Yep. Sure. Don't need so many skilled workmen in my place, and it's a lot of these cranky, wage-hogging, half-baked skilled mechanics that start trouble—reading a lot of this anarchist literature and union papers and all.”

“Do you approve of union labor?” Carol inquired of Mr. Elder.

“Me? I should say not! It's like this: I don't mind dealing with my men if they think they've got any grievances—though Lord knows what's come over workmen, nowadays—don't appreciate a good job. But still, if they come to me honestly, as man to man, I'll talk things over with them. But I'm not going to have any outsider, any of these walking delegates, or whatever fancy names they call themselves now—bunch of rich grafters, living on the ignorant workmen! Not going to have any of those fellows butting in and telling ME how to run MY business!”

Mr. Elder was growing more excited, more belligerent and patriotic. “I stand for freedom and constitutional rights. If any man don't like my shop, he can get up and git. Same way, if I don't like him, he gits. And that's all there is to it. I simply can't understand all these complications and hoop-te-doodles and government reports and wage-scales and God knows what all that these fellows are balling up the labor situation with, when it's all perfectly simple. They like what I pay 'em, or they get out. That's all there is to it!”

“What do you think of profit-sharing?” Carol ventured.

Mr. Elder thundered his answer, while the others nodded, solemnly and in tune, like a shop-window of flexible toys, comic mandarins and judges and ducks and clowns, set quivering by a breeze from the open door:

“All this profit-sharing and welfare work and insurance and old-age pension is simply poppycock. Enfeebles a workman's independence—and wastes a lot of honest profit. The half-baked thinker that isn't dry behind the ears yet, and these suffragettes and God knows what all buttinskis there are that are trying to tell a business man how to run his business, and some of these college professors are just about as bad, the whole kit and bilin' of 'em are nothing in God's world but socialism in disguise! And it's my bounden duty as a producer to resist every attack on the integrity of American industry to the last ditch. Yes—SIR!”

Mr. Elder wiped his brow.

Dave Dyer added, “Sure! You bet! What they ought to do is simply to hang every one of these agitators, and that would settle the whole thing right off. Don't you think so, doc?”

“You bet,” agreed Kennicott.

The conversation was at last relieved of the plague of Carol's intrusions and they settled down to the question of whether the justice of the peace had sent that hobo drunk to jail for ten days or twelve. It was a matter not readily determined. Then Dave Dyer communicated his carefree adventures on the gipsy trail:

“Yep. I get good time out of the flivver. 'Bout a week ago I motored down to New Wurttemberg. That's forty-three——No, let's see: It's seventeen miles to Belldale, and 'bout six and three-quarters, call it seven, to Torgenquist, and it's a good nineteen miles from there to New Wurttemberg—seventeen and seven and nineteen, that makes, uh, let me see: seventeen and seven 's twenty-four, plus nineteen, well say plus twenty, that makes forty-four, well anyway, say about forty-three or -four miles from here to New Wurttemberg. We got started about seven-fifteen, prob'ly seven-twenty, because I had to stop and fill the radiator, and we ran along, just keeping up a good steady gait——”

Mr. Dyer did finally, for reasons and purposes admitted and justified, attain to New Wurttemberg.

Once—only once—the presence of the alien Carol was recognized. Chet Dashaway leaned over and said asthmatically, “Say, uh, have you been reading this serial 'Two Out' in Tingling Tales? Corking yarn! Gosh, the fellow that wrote it certainly can sling baseball slang!”

The others tried to look literary. Harry Haydock offered, “Juanita is a great hand for reading high-class stuff, like 'Mid the Magnolias' by this Sara Hetwiggin Butts, and 'Riders of Ranch Reckless.' Books. But me,” he glanced about importantly, as one convinced that no other hero had ever been in so strange a plight, “I'm so darn busy I don't have much time to read.”

“I never read anything I can't check against,” said Sam Clark.

Thus ended the literary portion of the conversation, and for seven minutes Jackson Elder outlined reasons for believing that the pike-fishing was better on the west shore of Lake Minniemashie than on the east—though it was indeed quite true that on the east shore Nat Hicks had caught a pike altogether admirable.

The talk went on. It did go on! Their voices were monotonous, thick, emphatic. They were harshly pompous, like men in the smoking-compartments of Pullman cars. They did not bore Carol. They frightened her. She panted, “They will be cordial to me, because my man belongs to their tribe. God help me if I were an outsider!”

Smiling as changelessly as an ivory figurine she sat quiescent, avoiding thought, glancing about the living-room and hall, noting their betrayal of unimaginative commercial prosperity. Kennicott said, “Dandy interior, eh? My idea of how a place ought to be furnished. Modern.” She looked polite, and observed the oiled floors, hard-wood staircase, unused fireplace with tiles which resembled brown linoleum, cut-glass vases standing upon doilies, and the barred, shut, forbidding unit bookcases that were half filled with swashbuckler novels and unread-looking sets of Dickens, Kipling, O. Henry, and Elbert Hubbard.

She perceived that even personalities were failing to hold the party. The room filled with hesitancy as with a fog. People cleared their throats, tried to choke down yawns. The men shot their cuffs and the women stuck their combs more firmly into their back hair.

Then a rattle, a daring hope in every eye, the swinging of a door, the smell of strong coffee, Dave Dyer's mewing voice in a triumphant, “The eats!” They began to chatter. They had something to do. They could escape from themselves. They fell upon the food—chicken sandwiches, maple cake, drug-store ice cream. Even when the food was gone they remained cheerful. They could go home, any time now, and go to bed!

They went, with a flutter of coats, chiffon scarfs, and good-bys.

Carol and Kennicott walked home.

“Did you like them?” he asked.

“They were terribly sweet to me.”

“Uh, Carrie——You ought to be more careful about shocking folks. Talking about gold stockings, and about showing your ankles to schoolteachers and all!” More mildly: “You gave 'em a good time, but I'd watch out for that, 'f I were you. Juanita Haydock is such a damn cat. I wouldn't give her a chance to criticize me.”

“My poor effort to lift up the party! Was I wrong to try to amuse them?”

“No! No! Honey, I didn't mean——You were the only up-and-coming person in the bunch. I just mean——Don't get onto legs and all that immoral stuff. Pretty conservative crowd.”

She was silent, raw with the shameful thought that the attentive circle might have been criticizing her, laughing at her.

“Don't, please don't worry!” he pleaded.

“Silence.”

“Gosh; I'm sorry I spoke about it. I just meant——But they were crazy about you. Sam said to me, 'That little lady of yours is the slickest thing that ever came to this town,' he said; and Ma Dawson—I didn't hardly know whether she'd like you or not, she's such a dried-up old bird, but she said, 'Your bride is so quick and bright, I declare, she just wakes me up.'”

Carol liked praise, the flavor and fatness of it, but she was so energetically being sorry for herself that she could not taste this commendation.

“Please! Come on! Cheer up!” His lips said it, his anxious shoulder said it, his arm about her said it, as they halted on the obscure porch of their house.

“Do you care if they think I'm flighty, Will?”

“Me? Why, I wouldn't care if the whole world thought you were this or that or anything else. You're my—well, you're my soul!”

He was an undefined mass, as solid-seeming as rock. She found his sleeve, pinched it, cried, “I'm glad! It's sweet to be wanted! You must tolerate my frivolousness. You're all I have!”

He lifted her, carried her into the house, and with her arms about his neck she forgot Main Street.Embed"

À l’entrée de ce bassin, d’où l’on découvre tant d’objets, les échos de la montagne répètent sans cesse le bruit des vents qui agitent les forêts voisines, et le fracas des vagues qui brisent au loin sur les récifs ; mais au pied même des cabanes on n’entend plus aucun bruit, et on ne voit autour de soi que de grands rochers escarpés comme des murailles. Des bouquets d’arbres croissent à leurs bases, dans leurs fentes, et jusque sur leurs cimes, où s’arrêtent les nuages. Les pluies que leurs pitons attirent peignent souvent les couleurs de l’arc-en-ciel sur leurs flancs verts et bruns, et entretiennent à leurs pieds les sources dont se forme la petite rivière des Lataniers. Un grand silence règne dans leur enceinte, où tout est paisible, l’air, les eaux et la lumière. À peine l’écho y répète le murmure des palmistes qui croissent sur leurs plateaux élevés, et dont on voit les longues flèches toujours balancées par les vents. Un jour doux éclaire le fond de ce bassin, où le soleil ne luit qu’à midi ; mais dès l’aurore ses rayons en frappent le couronnement, dont les pics s’élevant au-dessus des ombres de la montagne, paraissent d’or et de pourpre sur l’azur des cieux.

J’aimois à me rendre dans ce lieu où l’on jouit à la fois d’une vue immense et d’une solitude profonde. Un jour que j’étois assis au pied de ces cabanes, et que j’en considérois les ruines, un homme déjà sur l’âge vint à passer aux environs. Il étoit, suivant la coutume des anciens habitants, en petite veste et en long caleçon. Il marchoit nu-pieds, et s’appuyoit sur un bâton de bois d’ébène. Ses cheveux étoient tout blancs, et sa physionomie noble et simple. Je le saluai avec respect. Il me rendit mon salut, et m’ayant considéré un moment, il s’approcha de moi, et vint se reposer sur le tertre où j’étois assis. Excité par cette marque de confiance, je lui adressai la parole : « Mon père, lui dis-je, pourriez-vous m’apprendre à qui ont appartenu ces deux cabanes ? » Il me répondit : « Mon fils, ces masures et ce terrain inculte étoient habités, il y a environ vingt ans, par deux familles qui y avoient trouvé le bonheur. Leur histoire est touchante : mais dans cette île, située sur la route des Indes, quel Européen peut s’intéresser au sort de quelques particuliers obscurs ? Qui voudroit même y vivre heureux, mais pauvre et ignoré ? Les hommes ne veulent connoître que l’histoire des grands et des rois, qui ne sert à personne. — Mon père, repris-je, il est aisé de juger à votre air et à votre discours que vous avez acquis une grande expérience. Si vous en avez le temps, racontez-moi, je vous prie, ce que vous savez des anciens habitants de ce désert, et croyez que l’homme même le plus dépravé par les préjugés du monde aime à entendre parler du bonheur que donnent la nature et la vertu. » Alors, comme quelqu’un qui cherche à se rappeler diverses circonstances, après avoir appuyé quelque temps ses mains sur son front, voici ce que ce vieillard me raconta.

En 1726 un jeune homme de Normandie, appelé M. de la Tour, après avoir sollicité en vain du service en France et des secours dans sa famille, se détermina à venir dans cette île pour y chercher fortune. Il avoit avec lui une jeune femme qu’il aimoit beaucoup et dont il étoit également aimé. Elle étoit d’une ancienne et riche maison de sa province ; mais il l’avoit épousée en secret et sans dot, parce que les parents de sa femme s’étoient opposés à son mariage, attendu qu’il n’étoit pas gentilhomme. Il la laissa au Port Louis de cette île, et il s’embarqua pour Madagascar dans l’espérance d’y acheter quelques Noirs, et de revenir promptement ici former une habitation. Il débarqua à Madagascar vers la mauvaise saison qui commence à la mi-octobre ; et peu de temps après son arrivée il y mourut des fièvres pestilentielles qui y règnent pendant six mois de l’année, et qui empêcheront toujours les nations européennes d’y faire des établissements fixes. Les effets qu’il avoit emportés avec lui furent dispersés après sa mort, comme il arrive ordinairement à ceux qui meurent hors de leur patrie. Sa femme, restée à l’Ile de France, se trouva veuve, enceinte, et n’ayant pour tout bien au monde qu’une négresse, dans un pays où elle n’avoit ni crédit ni recommandation. Ne voulant rien solliciter auprès d’aucun homme après la mort de celui qu’elle avoit uniquement aimé, son malheur lui donna du courage. Elle résolut de cultiver avec son esclave un petit coin de terre, afin de se procurer de quoi vivre.

Dans une île presque déserte dont le terrain étoit à discrétion elle ne choisit point les cantons les plus fertiles ni les plus favorables au commerce ; mais cherchant quelque gorge de montagne, quelque asile caché où elle pût vivre seule et inconnue, elle s’achemina de la ville vers ces rochers pour s’y retirer comme dans un nid. C’est un instinct commun à tous les êtres sensibles et souffrants de se réfugier dans les lieux les plus sauvages et les plus déserts ; comme si des rochers étoient des remparts contre l’infortune, et comme si le calme de la nature pouvoit apaiser les troubles malheureux de l’âme. Mais la Providence, qui vient à notre secours lorsque nous ne voulons que les biens nécessaires, en réservoit un à madame de la Tour que ne donnent ni les richesses ni la grandeur ; c’étoit une amie.

Dans ce lieu depuis un an demeuroit une femme vive, bonne et sensible ; elle s’appeloit Marguerite. Elle étoit née en Bretagne d’une simple famille de paysans, dont elle étoit chérie, et qui l’auroit rendue heureuse, si elle n’avoit eu la faiblesse d’ajouter foi à l’amour d’un gentilhomme de son voisinage qui lui avoit promis de l’épouser ; mais celui-ci ayant satisfait sa passion s’éloigna d’elle, et refusa même de lui assurer une subsistance pour un enfant dont il l’avoit laissée enceinte. Elle s’étoit déterminée alors à quitter pour toujours le village où elle étoit née, et à aller cacher sa faute aux colonies, loin de son pays, où elle avoit perdu la seule dot d’une fille pauvre et honnête, la réputation. Un vieux Noir, qu’elle avoit acquis de quelques deniers empruntés, cultivoit avec elle un petit coin de ce canton.

Madame de la Tour, suivie de sa négresse, trouva dans ce lieu Marguerite qui allaitoit son enfant. Elle fut charmée de rencontrer une femme dans une position qu’elle jugea semblable à la sienne. Elle lui parla en peu de mots de sa condition passée et de ses besoins présents. Marguerite au récit de madame de la Tour fut émue de pitié ; et, voulant mériter sa confiance plutôt que son estime, elle lui avoua sans lui rien déguiser l’imprudence dont elle s’étoit rendue coupable.

« Pour moi, dit-elle, j’ai mérité mon sort ; mais vous, madame…, vous, sage et malheureuse ! » Et elle lui offrit en pleurant sa cabane et son amitié. Madame de la Tour, touchée d’un accueil si tendre, lui dit en la serrant dans ses bras : « Ah ! Dieu veut finir mes peines, puisqu’il vous inspire plus de bonté envers moi qui vous suis étrangère, que jamais je n’en ai trouvé dans mes parents. »

Je connoissois Marguerite, et quoique je demeure à une lieue et demie d’ici, dans les bois, derrière la Montagne Longue, je me regardois comme son voisin. Dans les villes d’Europe une rue, un simple mur, empêchent les membres d’une même famille de se réunir pendant des années entières ; mais dans les colonies nouvelles on considère comme ses voisins ceux dont on n’est séparé que par des bois et par des montagnes. Dans ce temps-là surtout, où cette île faisoit peu de commerce aux Indes, le simple voisinage y étoit un titre d’amitié, et l’hospitalité envers les étrangers un devoir et un plaisir. Lorsque j’appris que ma voisine avoit une compagne, je fus la voir pour tâcher d’être utile à l’une et à l’autre. Je trouvai dans madame de la Tour une personne d’une figure intéressante, pleine de noblesse et de mélancolie. Elle étoit alors sur le point d’accoucher. Je dis à ces deux dames qu’il convenoit, pour l’intérêt de leurs enfants, et surtout pour empêcher l’établissement de quelque autre habitant, de partager entre elles le fond de ce bassin, qui contient environ vingt arpents. Elles s’en rapportèrent à moi pour ce partage. J’en formai deux portions à peu près égales ; l’une renfermoit la partie supérieure de cette enceinte, depuis ce piton de rocher couvert de nuages, d’où sort la source de la Rivière des Lataniers, jusqu’à cette ouverture escarpée que vous voyez au haut de la montagne, et qu’on appelle l’Embrasure, parce qu’elle ressemble en effet à une embrasure de canon. Le fond de ce sol est si rempli de roches et de ravins qu’à peine on y peut marcher ; cependant il produit de grands arbres, et il est rempli de fontaines et de petits ruisseaux. Dans l’autre portion je compris toute la partie inférieure qui s’étend le long de la Rivière des Lataniers jusqu’à l’ouverture où nous sommes, d’où cette rivière commence à couler entre deux collines jusqu’à la mer. Vous y voyez quelques lisières de prairies, et un terrain assez uni, mais qui n’est guère meilleur que l’autre ; car dans la saison des pluies il est marécageux, et dans les sécheresses il est dur comme du plomb ; quand on y veut alors ouvrir une tranchée, on est obligé de le couper avec des haches. Après avoir fait ces deux partages j’engageai ces deux dames à les tirer au sort. La partie supérieure échut à madame de la Tour, et l’inférieure à Marguerite. L’une et l’autre furent contentes de leur lot ; mais elles me prièrent de ne pas séparer leur demeure, « afin, me dirent-elles, que nous puissions toujours nous voir, nous parler et nous entraider ». Il falloit cependant à chacune d’elles une retraite particulière. La case de Marguerite se trouvoit au milieu du bassin précisément sur les limites de son terrain. Je bâtis tout auprès, sur celui de madame de la Tour, une autre case, en sorte que ces deux amies étoient à la fois dans le voisinage l’une de l’autre et sur la propriété de leurs familles. Moi-même j’ai coupé des palissades dans la montagne ; j’ai apporté des feuilles de latanier des bords de la mer pour construire ces deux cabanes, où vous ne voyez plus maintenant ni porte ni couverture. Hélas ! il n’en reste encore que trop pour mon souvenir ! Le temps, qui détruit si rapidement les monuments des empires, semble respecter dans ces déserts ceux de l’amitié, pour perpétuer mes regrets jusqu’à la fin de ma vie. À peine la seconde de ces cabanes étoit achevée que madame de la Tour accoucha d’une fille. J’avois été le parrain de l’enfant de Marguerite, qui s’appeloit Paul. Madame de la Tour me pria aussi de nommer sa fille conjointement avec son amie. Celle-ci lui donna le nom de Virginie. « Elle sera vertueuse, dit-elle, et elle sera heureuse. Je n’ai connu le malheur qu’en m’écartant de la vertu ».

Lorsque madame de la Tour fut relevée de ses couches, ces deux petites habitations commencèrent à être de quelque rapport, à l’aide des soins que j’y donnois de temps en temps, mais surtout par les travaux assidus de leurs esclaves. Celui de Marguerite, appelé Domingue, étoit un Noir yolof, encore robuste, quoique déjà sur l’âge. Il avoit de l’expérience et un bon sens naturel. Il cultivoit indifféremment sur les deux habitations les terrains qui lui sembloient les plus fertiles, et il y mettoit les semences qui leur convenoient le mieux. Il semoit du petit mil et du maïs dans les endroits médiocres, un peu de froment dans les bonnes terres, du riz dans les fonds marécageux ; et au pied des roches, des giraumons, des courges et des concombres, qui se plaisent à y grimper. Il plantoit dans les lieux secs des patates qui y viennent très sucrées, des cotonniers sur les hauteurs, des cannes à sucre dans les terres fortes, des pieds de café sur les collines, où le grain est petit, mais excellent ; le long de la rivière et autour des cases, des bananiers qui donnent toute l’année de longs régimes de fruits avec un bel ombrage, et enfin quelques plantes de tabac pour charmer ses soucis et ceux de ses bonnes maîtresses. Il alloit couper du bois à brûler dans la montagne, et casser des roches çà et là dans les habitations pour en aplanir les chemins. Il faisoit tous ces ouvrages avec intelligence et activité, parce qu’il les faisoit avec zèle. Il étoit fort attaché à Marguerite ; et il ne l’étoit guère moins à madame de la Tour, dont il avoit épousé la négresse à la naissance de Virginie. Il aimoit passionnément sa femme, qui s’appeloit Marie. Elle étoit née à Madagascar, d’où elle avoit apporté quelque industrie, surtout celle de faire des paniers et des étoffes appelées pagnes, avec des herbes qui croissent dans les bois. Elle étoit adroite, propre, et très fidèle. Elle avoit soin de préparer à manger, d’élever quelques poules, et d’aller de temps en temps vendre au Port Louis le superflu de ces deux habitations, qui étoit bien peu considérable. Si vous y joignez deux chèvres élevées près des enfants, et un gros chien qui veilloit la nuit au-dehors, vous aurez une idée de tout le revenu et de tout le domestique de ces deux petites métairies.

Pour ces deux amies, elles filoient du matin au soir du coton. Ce travail suffisoit à leur entretien et à celui de leurs familles ; mais d’ailleurs elles étoient si dépourvues de commodités étrangères qu’elles marchoient nu-pieds dans leur habitation, et ne portoient de souliers que pour aller le dimanche de grand matin à la messe à l’église des Pamplemousses que vous voyez là-bas. Il y a cependant bien plus loin qu’au Port Louis ; mais elles se rendoient rarement à la ville, de peur d’y être méprisées, parce qu’elles étoient vêtues de grosse toile bleue du Bengale comme des esclaves. Après tout, la considération publique vaut-elle le bonheur domestique ? Si ces dames avoient un peu à souffrir au-dehors, elles rentroient chez elles avec d’autant plus de plaisir. À peine Marie et Domingue les apercevoient de cette hauteur sur le chemin des Pamplemousses, qu’ils accouroient jusqu’au bas de la montagne pour les aider à la remonter. Elles lisoient dans les yeux de leurs esclaves la joie qu’ils avoient de les revoir. Elles trouvoient chez elles la propreté, la liberté, des biens qu’elles ne devoient qu’à leurs propres travaux, et des serviteurs pleins de zèle et d’affection. Elles-mêmes, unies par les mêmes besoins, ayant éprouvé des maux presque semblables, se donnant les doux noms d’amie, de compagne et de sœur, n’avoient qu’une volonté, qu’un intérêt, qu’une table. Tout entre elles étoit commun. Seulement si d’anciens feux plus vifs que ceux de l’amitié se réveilloient dans leur âme, une religion pure, aidée par des mœurs chastes, les dirigeoit vers une autre vie, comme la flamme qui s’envole vers le ciel lorsqu’elle n’a plus d’aliment sur la terre.

Les devoirs de la nature ajoutoient encore au bonheur de leur société. Leur amitié mutuelle redoubloit à la vue de leurs enfants, fruits d’un amour également infortuné. Elles prenoient plaisir à les mettre ensemble dans le même bain, et à les coucher dans le même berceau. Souvent elles les changeoient de lait. « Mon amie, disoit madame de la Tour, chacune de nous aura deux enfants, et chacun de nos enfants aura deux mères. » Comme deux bourgeons qui restent sur deux arbres de la même espèce, dont la tempête a brisé toutes les branches, viennent à produire des fruits plus doux, si chacun d’eux, détaché du tronc maternel, est greffé sur le tronc voisin ; ainsi ces deux petits enfants, privés de tous leurs parents, se remplissoient de sentiments plus tendres que ceux de fils et de fille, de frère et de sœur, quand ils venoient à être changés de mamelles par les deux amies qui leur avoient donné le jour. Déjà leurs mères parloient de leur mariage sur leurs berceaux, et cette perspective de félicité conjugale, dont elles charmoient leurs propres peines, finissoit bien souvent par les faire pleurer ; l’une se rappelant que ses maux étoient venus d’avoir négligé l’hymen, et l’autre d’en avoir subi les lois ; l’une, de s’être élevée au-dessus de sa condition, et l’autre d’en être descendue : mais elles se consoloient en pensant qu’un jour leurs enfants, plus heureux, jouiroient à la fois, loin les cruels préjugés de l’Europe, des plaisirs de l’amour et du bonheur de l’égalité.

Rien en effet n’étoit comparable à l’attachement qu’ils se témoignoient déjà. Si Paul venoit à se plaindre, on lui montroit Virginie ; à sa vue il sourioit et s’apaisoit. Si Virginie souffroit, on en étoit averti par les cris de Paul ; mais cette aimable fille dissimuloit aussitôt son mal pour qu’il ne souffrît pas de sa douleur. Je n’arrivois point de fois ici que je ne les visse tous deux tout nus, suivant la coutume du pays, pouvant à peine marcher, se tenant ensemble par les mains et sous les bras, comme on représente la constellation des Gémeaux. La nuit même ne pouvoit les séparer ; elle les surprenoit souvent couchés dans le même berceau, joue contre joue, poitrine contre poitrine, les mains passées mutuellement autour de leurs cous, et endormis dans les bras l’un de l’autre.
Lorsqu’ils surent parler, les premiers noms qu’ils apprirent à se donner furent ceux de frère et de sœur. L’enfance, qui connoît des caresses plus tendres, ne connoît point de plus doux noms. Leur éducation ne fit que redoubler leur amitié en la dirigeant vers leurs besoins réciproques. Bientôt tout ce qui regarde l’économie, la propreté, le soin de préparer un repas champêtre, fut du ressort de Virginie, et ses travaux étoient toujours suivis des louanges et des baisers de son frère. Pour lui, sans cesse en action, il bêchoit le jardin avec Domingue, ou, une petite hache à la main, il le suivoit dans les bois ; et si dans ces courses une belle fleur, un bon fruit, ou un nid d’oiseaux se présentoient à lui, eussent-ils été au haut d’un arbre, il l’escaladoit pour les apporter à sa sœur.

Quand on en rencontroit un quelque part on étoit sûr que l’autre n’étoit pas loin. Un jour que je descendois du sommet de cette montagne, j’aperçus à l’extrémité du jardin Virginie qui accouroit vers la maison, la tête couverte de son jupon qu’elle avoit relevé par derrière, pour se mettre à l’abri d’une ondée de pluie. De loin je la crus seule ; et m’étant avancé vers elle pour l’aider à marcher, je vis qu’elle tenoit Paul par le bras, enveloppé presque en entier de la même couverture, riant l’un et l’autre d’être ensemble à l’abri sous un parapluie de leur invention. Ces deux têtes charmantes renfermées sous ce jupon bouffant me rappelèrent les enfants de Léda enclos dans la même coquille.

Toute leur étude étoit de se complaire et de s’entraider. Au reste ils étoient ignorants comme des Créoles, et ne savoient ni lire ni écrire. Ils ne s’inquiétoient pas de ce qui s’étoit passé dans des temps reculés et loin d’eux ; leur curiosité ne s’étendoit pas au-delà de cette montagne. Ils croyoient que le monde finissoit où finissoit leur île ; et ils n’imaginoient rien d’aimable où ils n’étoient pas. Leur affection mutuelle et celle de leurs mères occupoient toute l’activité de leurs âmes. Jamais des sciences inutiles n’avoient fait couler leurs larmes ; jamais les leçons d’une triste morale ne les avoient remplis d’ennui. Ils ne savoient pas qu’il ne faut pas dérober, tout chez eux étant commun ; ni être intempérant, ayant à discrétion des mets simples ; ni menteur, n’ayant aucune vérité à dissimuler. On ne les avoit jamais effrayés en leur disant que Dieu réserve des punitions terribles aux enfants ingrats ; chez eux l’amitié filiale étoit née de l’amitié maternelle. On ne leur avoit appris de la religion que ce qui la fait aimer ; et s’ils n’offroient pas à l’église de longues prières, partout où ils étoient, dans la maison, dans les champs, dans les bois, ils levoient vers le ciel des mains innocentes et un cœur plein de l’amour de leurs parents.

Ainsi se passa leur première enfance comme une belle aube qui annonce un plus beau jour. Déjà ils partageoient avec leurs mères tous les soins du ménage. Dès que le chant du coq annonçoit le retour de l’aurore, Virginie se levoit, alloit puiser de l’eau à la source voisine, et rentroit dans la maison pour préparer le déjeuner. Bientôt après, quand le soleil doroit les pitons de cette enceinte, Marguerite et son fils se rendoient chez madame de la Tour : alors ils commençoient tous ensemble une prière suivie du premier repas ; souvent ils le prenoient devant la porte, assis sur l’herbe sous un berceau de bananiers, qui leur fournissait à la fois des mets tout préparés dans leurs fruits substantiels, et du linge de table dans leurs feuilles larges, longues, et lustrées. Une nourriture saine et abondante développoit rapidement les corps de ces deux jeunes gens, et une éducation douce peignoit dans leur physionomie la pureté et le contentement de leur âme. Virginie n’avoit que douze ans ; déjà sa taille étoit plus qu’à demi formée ; de grands cheveux blonds ombrageoient sa tête ; ses yeux bleus et ses lèvres de corail brilloient du plus tendre éclat sur la fraîcheur de son visage : ils sourioient toujours de concert quand elle parloit ; mais quand elle gardoit le silence, leur obliquité naturelle vers le ciel leur donnoit une expression d’une sensibilité extrême, et même celle d’une légère mélancolie. Pour Paul, on voyoit déjà se développer en lui le caractère d’un homme au milieu des grâces de l’adolescence. Sa taille étoit plus élevée que celle de Virginie, son teint plus rembruni, son nez plus aquilin, et ses yeux, qui étoient noirs, auroient eu un peu de fierté, si les longs cils qui rayonnoient autour comme des pinceaux ne leur avoient donné la plus grande douceur. Quoiqu’il fût toujours en mouvement, dès que sa sœur paraissoit il devenoit tranquille et alloit s’asseoir auprès d’elle. Souvent leur repas se passoit sans qu’ils se dissent un mot. À leur silence, à la naïveté de leurs attitudes, à la beauté de leurs pieds nus, on eût cru voir un groupe antique de marbre blanc représentant quelques-uns des enfants de Niobé ; mais à leurs regards qui cherchoient à se rencontrer, à leurs sourires rendus par de plus doux sourires, on les eût pris pour ces enfants du ciel, pour ces esprits bienheureux dont la nature est de s’aimer, et qui n’ont pas besoin de rendre le sentiment par des pensées, et l’amitié par des paroles.

Cependant madame de la Tour, voyant sa fille se développer avec tant de charmes, sentoit augmenter son inquiétude avec sa tendresse. Elle me disoit quelquefois : « Si je venois à mourir, que deviendroit Virginie sans fortune ? »

Elle avoit en France une tante, fille de qualité, riche, vieille et dévote, qui lui avoit refusé si durement des secours lorsqu’elle se fut mariée à M. de la Tour, qu’elle s’étoit bien promis de n’avoir jamais recours à elle à quelque extrémité qu’elle fût réduite. Mais devenue mère, elle ne craignit plus la honte des refus. Elle manda à sa tante la mort inattendue de son mari, la naissance de sa fille, et l’embarras où elle se trouvoit, loin de son pays, dénuée de support, et chargée d’un enfant. Elle n’en reçut point de réponse. Elle qui étoit d’un caractère élevé, ne craignit plus de s’humilier, et de s’exposer aux reproches de sa parente, qui ne lui avoit jamais pardonné d’avoir épousé un homme sans naissance, quoique vertueux. Elle lui écrivoit donc par toutes les occasions afin d’exciter sa sensibilité en faveur de Virginie. Mais bien des années s’étoient écoulées sans recevoir d’elle aucune marque de souvenir.

Enfin en 1738, trois ans après l’arrivée de M. de la Bourdonnais dans cette île, madame de la Tour apprit que ce gouverneur avoit à lui remettre une lettre de la part de sa tante. Elle courut au Port Louis sans se soucier cette fois d’y paroître mal vêtue, la joie maternelle la mettant au-dessus du respect humain. M. de la Bourdonnais lui donna en effet une lettre de sa tante. Celle-ci mandoit à sa nièce qu’elle avoit mérité son sort pour avoir épousé un aventurier, un libertin ; que les passions portoient avec elles leur punition ; que la mort prématurée de son mari étoit un juste châtiment de Dieu ; qu’elle avoit bien fait de passer aux îles plutôt que de déshonorer sa famille en France ; qu’elle étoit après tout dans un bon pays où tout le monde faisoit fortune, excepté les paresseux. Après l’avoir ainsi blâmée elle finissoit par se louer elle-même : pour éviter, disoit-elle, les suites souvent funestes du mariage, elle avoit toujours refusé de se marier. La vérité est qu’étant ambitieuse, elle n’avoit voulu épouser qu’un homme de grande qualité ; mais quoiqu’elle fût très riche, et qu’à la cour on soit indifférent à tout excepté à la fortune, il ne s’étoit trouvé personne qui eût voulu s’allier à une fille aussi laide, et à un cœur aussi dur.

Elle ajoutoit par post-scriptum que, toute réflexion faite, elle l’avoit fortement recommandée à M. de la Bourdonnais. Elle l’avoit en effet recommandée, mais suivant un usage bien commun aujourd’hui, qui rend un protecteur plus à craindre qu’un ennemi déclaré : afin de justifier auprès du gouverneur sa dureté pour sa nièce, en feignant de la plaindre, elle l’avoit calomniée.

Madame de la Tour, que tout homme indifférent n’eût pu voir sans intérêt et sans respect, fut reçue avec beaucoup de froideur par M. de la Bourdonnais, prévenu contre elle. Il ne répondit à l’exposé qu’elle lui fit de sa situation et de celle de sa fille que par de durs monosyllabes : « Je verrai ; … nous verrons ; … avec le temps : … il y a bien des malheureux… Pourquoi indisposer une tante respectable ? … C’est vous qui avez tort. »

Madame de la Tour retourna à l’habitation, le cœur navré de douleur et plein d’amertume. En arrivant elle s’assit, jeta sur la table la lettre de sa tante, et dit à son amie : « Voilà le fruit de onze ans de patience ! » Mais comme il n’y avoit que madame de la Tour qui sût lire dans la société, elle reprit la lettre et en fit la lecture devant toute la famille rassemblée. À peine était-elle achevée que Marguerite lui dit avec vivacité : « Qu’avons-nous besoin de tes parents ? Dieu nous a-t-il abandonnées ? c’est lui seul qui est notre père. N’avons-nous pas vécu heureuses jusqu’à ce jour ? Pourquoi donc te chagriner ? Tu n’as point de courage. » Et voyant madame de la Tour pleurer, elle se jeta à son cou, et la serrant dans ses bras : « Chère amie, s’écria-t-elle, chère amie ! » mais ses propres sanglots étouffèrent sa voix. À ce spectacle Virginie, fondant en larmes, pressoit alternativement les mains de sa mère et celles de Marguerite contre sa bouche et contre son cœur ; et Paul, les yeux enflammés de colère, crioit, serroit les poings, frappoit du pied, ne sachant à qui s’en prendre. À ce bruit Domingue et Marie accoururent, et l’on n’entendit plus dans la case que ces cris de douleur : « Ah, madame ! … ma bonne maîtresse ! … ma mère ! … ne pleurez pas. » De si tendres marques d’amitié dissipèrent le chagrin de madame de la Tour. Elle prit Paul et Virginie dans ses bras, et leur dit d’un air content : « Mes enfants, vous êtes cause de ma peine ; mais vous faites toute ma joie. Oh ! mes chers enfants, le malheur ne m’est venu que de loin ; le bonheur est autour de moi. » Paul et Virginie ne la comprirent pas, mais quand ils la virent tranquille ils sourirent, et se mirent à la caresser. Ainsi ils continuèrent tous d’être heureux, et ce ne fut qu’un orage au milieu d’une belle saison.

Le bon naturel de ces enfants se développoit de jour en jour. Un dimanche, au lever de l’aurore, leurs mères étant allées à la première messe à l’église des Pamplemousses, une négresse marronne se présenta sous les bananiers qui entouroient leur habitation. Elle étoit décharnée comme un squelette, et n’avoit pour vêtement qu’un lambeau de serpillière autour des reins. Elle se jeta aux pieds de Virginie, qui préparoit le déjeuner de la famille, et lui dit : « Ma jeune demoiselle, ayez pitié d’une pauvre esclave fugitive ; il y a un mois que j’erre dans ces montagnes demi-morte de faim, souvent poursuivie par des chasseurs et par leurs chiens. Je fuis mon maître, qui est un riche habitant de la Rivière Noire : il m’a traitée comme vous le voyez »  ; en même temps elle lui montra son corps sillonné de cicatrices profondes par les coups de fouet qu’elle en avoit reçus. Elle ajouta : « Je voulois aller me noyer ; mais sachant que vous demeuriez ici, j’ai dit : Puisqu’il y a encore de bons Blancs dans ce pays il ne faut pas encore mourir. » Virginie, tout émue, lui répondit : « Rassurez-vous, infortunée créature ! Mangez, mangez »  ; et elle lui donna le déjeuner de la maison, qu’elle avoit apprêté. L’esclave en peu de moments le dévora tout entier. Virginie la voyant rassasiée lui dit : « Pauvre misérable ! j’ai envie d’aller demander votre grâce à votre maître ; en vous voyant il sera touché de pitié. Voulez-vous me conduire chez lui ? — Ange de Dieu, repartit la négresse, je vous suivrai partout où vous voudrez ». Virginie appela son frère, et le pria de l’accompagner. L’esclave marronne les conduisit par des sentiers, au milieu des bois, à travers de hautes montagnes qu’ils grimpèrent avec bien de la peine, et de larges rivières qu’ils passèrent à gué. Enfin, vers le milieu du jour, ils arrivèrent au bas d’un morne sur les bords de la Rivière Noire. Ils aperçurent là une maison bien bâtie, des plantations considérables, et un grand nombre d’esclaves occupés à toutes sortes de travaux. Leur maître se promenoit au milieu d’eux, une pipe à la bouche, et un rotin à la main. C’étoit un grand homme sec, olivâtre, aux yeux enfoncés, et aux sourcils noirs et joints. Virginie, tout émue, tenant Paul par le bras, s’approcha de l’habitant, et le pria, pour l’amour de Dieu, de pardonner à son esclave, qui étoit à quelques pas de là derrière eux. D’abord l’habitant ne fit pas grand compte de ces deux enfants pauvrement vêtus ; mais quand il eut remarqué la taille élégante de Virginie, sa belle tête blonde sous une capote bleue, et qu’il eut entendu le doux son de sa voix, qui trembloit ainsi que tout son corps en lui demandant grâce, il ôta sa pipe de sa bouche, et levant son rotin vers le ciel, il jura par un affreux serment qu’il pardonnoit à son esclave, non pas pour l’amour de Dieu, mais pour l’amour d’elle. Virginie aussitôt fit signe à l’esclave de s’avancer vers son maître ; puis elle s’enfuit, et Paul courut après elle.

Ils remontèrent ensemble le revers du morne par où ils étoient descendus, et parvenus au sommet ils s’assirent sous un arbre, accablés de lassitude, de faim et de soif. Ils avoient fait à jeun plus de cinq lieues depuis le lever du soleil. Paul dit à Virginie : « Ma sœur, il est plus de midi ; tu as faim et soif : nous ne trouverons point ici à dîner ; redescendons le morne, et allons demander à manger au maître de l’esclave. — Oh non, mon ami, reprit Virginie, il m’a fait trop de peur. Souviens-toi de ce que dit quelquefois maman : Le pain du méchant remplit la bouche de gravier. — Comment ferons-nous donc ? dit Paul ; ces arbres ne produisent que de mauvais fruits ; il n’y a pas seulement ici un tamarin ou un citron pour te rafraîchir. — Dieu aura pitié de nous, reprit Virginie ; il exauce la voix des petits oiseaux qui lui demandent de la nourriture. » À peine avoit-elle dit ces mots qu’ils entendirent le bruit d’une source qui tomboit d’un rocher voisin. Ils y coururent, et après s’être désaltérés avec ses eaux plus claires que le cristal, ils cueillirent et mangèrent un peu de cresson qui croissoit sur ses bords. Comme ils regardoient de côté et d’autre s’ils ne trouveroient pas quelque nourriture plus solide, Virginie aperçut parmi les arbres de la forêt un jeune palmiste. Le chou que la cime de cet arbre renferme au milieu de ses feuilles est un fort bon manger ; mais quoique sa tige ne fût pas plus grosse que la jambe, elle avoit plus de soixante pieds de hauteur. À la vérité le bois de cet arbre n’est formé que d’un paquet de filaments, mais son aubier est si dur qu’il fait rebrousser les meilleures haches ; et Paul n’avoit pas même un couteau. L’idée lui vint de mettre le feu au pied de ce palmiste : autre embarras ; il n’avoit point de briquet, et d’ailleurs dans cette île si couverte de rochers je ne crois pas qu’on puisse trouver une seule pierre à fusil. La nécessité donne de l’industrie, et souvent les inventions les plus utiles ont été dues aux hommes les plus misérables. Paul résolut d’allumer du feu à la manière des Noirs : avec l’angle d’une pierre il fit un petit trou sur une branche d’arbre bien sèche, qu’il assujettit sous ses pieds, puis avec le tranchant de cette pierre il fit une pointe à un autre morceau de branche également sèche, mais d’une espèce de bois différent ; il posa ensuite ce morceau de bois pointu dans le petit trou de la branche qui étoit sous ses pieds, et le faisant rouler rapidement entre ses mains comme on roule un moulinet dont on veut faire mousser du chocolat, en peu de moments il vit sortir du point de contact de la fumée et des étincelles. Il ramassa des herbes sèches et d’autres branches d’arbres, et mit le feu au pied du palmiste, qui bientôt après tomba avec un grand fracas. Le feu lui servit encore à dépouiller le chou de l’enveloppe de ses longues feuilles ligneuses et piquantes. Virginie et lui mangèrent une partie de ce chou crue, et l’autre cuite sous la cendre, et ils les trouvèrent également savoureuses. Ils firent ce repas frugal remplis de joie par le souvenir de la bonne action qu’ils avoient faite le matin ; mais cette joie étoit troublée par l’inquiétude où ils se doutoient bien que leur longue absence de la maison jetteroit leurs mères. Virginie revenoit souvent sur cet objet ; cependant Paul, qui sentoit ses forces rétablies, l’assura qu’ils ne tarderoient pas à tranquilliser leurs parents.

Après dîner ils se trouvèrent bien embarrassés ; car ils n’avoient plus de guide pour les reconduire chez eux. Paul, qui ne s’étonnoit de rien, dit à Virginie :
« Notre case est vers le soleil du milieu du jour ; il faut que nous passions, comme ce matin, par-dessus cette montagne que tu vois là-bas avec ses trois pitons. Allons, marchons, mon amie ». Cette montagne étoit celle des Trois-Mamelles, ainsi nommée parce que ses trois pitons en ont la forme. Ils descendirent donc le morne de la Rivière Noire du côté du nord, et arrivèrent après une heure de marche sur les bords d’une large rivière qui barroit leur chemin. Cette grande partie de l’île, toute couverte de forêts, est si peu connue même aujourd’hui que plusieurs de ses rivières et de ses montagnes n’y ont pas encore de nom. La rivière sur le bord de laquelle ils étoient coule en bouillonnant sur un lit de roches. Le bruit de ses eaux effraya Virginie ; elle n’osa y mettre les pieds pour la passer à gué. Paul alors prit Virginie sur son dos, et passa ainsi chargé sur les roches glissantes de la rivière malgré le tumulte de ses eaux. « N’aie pas peur, lui disoit-il ; je me sens bien fort avec toi. Si l’habitant de la Rivière Noire t’avoit refusé la grâce de son esclave, je me serois battu avec lui. — Comment ! dit Virginie, avec cet homme si grand et si méchant ? À quoi t’ai-je exposé ! Mon Dieu ! qu’il est difficile de faire le bien ! il n’y a que le mal de facile à faire. » Quand Paul fut sur le rivage, il voulut continuer sa route chargé de sa sœur, et il se flattoit de monter ainsi la montagne des Trois-Mamelles qu’il voyoit devant lui à une demi-lieue mais bientôt les forces lui manquèrent, et il fut obligé de la mettre à terre, et de se reposer auprès d’elle. Virginie lui dit alors : « Mon frère, le jour baisse ; tu as encore des forces, et les miennes me manquent ; laisse-moi ici, et retourne seul à notre case pour tranquilliser nos mères. — Oh ! non, dit Paul, je ne te quitterai pas. Si la nuit nous surprend dans ces bois, j’allumerai du feu, j’abattrai un palmiste, tu en mangeras le chou, et je ferai avec ses feuilles un ajoupa, pour te mettre à l’abri. » Cependant Virginie, s’étant un peu reposée, cueillit sur le tronc d’un vieux arbre penché sur le bord de la rivière de longues feuilles de scolopendre qui pendoient de son tronc ; elle en fit des espèces de brodequins dont elle s’entoura les pieds, que les pierres des chemins avoient mis en sang ; car dans l’empressement d’être utile elle avoit oublié de se chausser. Se sentant soulagée par la fraîcheur de ces feuilles, elle rompit une branche de bambou et se mit en marche en s’appuyant d’une main sur ce roseau, et de l’autre sur son frère.

Ils cheminoient ainsi doucement à travers les bois ; mais la hauteur des arbres et l’épaisseur de leurs feuillages leur firent bientôt perdre de vue la montagne des Trois-Mamelles sur laquelle ils se dirigeoient, et même le soleil qui étoit déjà près de se coucher. Au bout de quelque temps ils quittèrent sans s’en apercevoir le sentier frayé dans lequel ils avoient marché jusqu’alors, et ils se trouvèrent dans un labyrinthe d’arbres, de lianes, et de roches, qui n’avoit plus d’issue. Paul fit asseoir Virginie, et se mit à courir çà et là, tout hors de lui, pour chercher un chemin hors de ce fourré épais ; mais il se fatigua en vain. Il monta au haut d’un grand arbre pour découvrir au moins la montagne des Trois-Mamelles ; mais il n’aperçut autour de lui que les cimes des arbres, dont quelques-unes étoient éclairées par les derniers rayons du soleil couchant. Cependant l’ombre des montagnes couvroit déjà les forêts dans les vallées ; le vent se calmoit, comme il arrive au coucher du soleil ; un profond silence régnoit dans ces solitudes, et on n’y entendoit d’autre bruit que le bramement des cerfs qui venoient chercher leur gîte dans ces lieux écartés. Paul, dans l’espoir que quelque chasseur pourroit l’entendre, cria alors de toute sa force : « Venez, venez au secours de Virginie ! » mais les seuls échos de la forêt répondirent à sa voix, et répétèrent à plusieurs reprises : « Virginie… Virginie. »

Paul descendit alors de l’arbre, accablé de fatigue et de chagrin : il chercha les moyens de passer la nuit dans ce lieu ; mais il n’y avoit ni fontaine, ni palmiste, ni même de branche de bois sec propre à allumer du feu. Il sentit alors par son expérience toute la faiblesse de ses ressources, et il se mit à pleurer. Virginie lui dit :

« Ne pleure point, mon ami, si tu ne veux m’accabler de chagrin. C’est moi qui suis la cause de toutes tes peines, et de celles qu’éprouvent maintenant nos mères. Il ne faut rien faire, pas même le bien, sans consulter ses parents. Oh ! j’ai été bien imprudente ! » et elle se prit à verser des larmes. Cependant elle dit à Paul : « Prions Dieu, mon frère, et il aura pitié de nous. » À peine avoient-ils achevé leur prière qu’ils entendirent un chien aboyer. « C’est, dit Paul, le chien de quelque chasseur qui vient le soir tuer des cerfs à l’affût. » Peu après, les aboiements du chien redoublèrent. « Il me semble, dit Virginie, que c’est Fidèle, le chien de notre case ; oui, je reconnois sa voix : serions-nous si près d’arriver et au pied de notre montagne ? » En effet un moment après Fidèle étoit à leurs pieds, aboyant, hurlant, gémissant et les accablant de caresses. Comme ils ne pouvoient revenir de leur surprise, ils aperçurent Domingue qui accouroit à eux. À l’arrivée de ce bon Noir, qui pleuroit de joie, ils se mirent aussi à pleurer sans pouvoir lui dire un mot. Quand Domingue eut repris ses sens : « Ô mes jeunes maîtres, leur dit-il, que vos mères ont d’inquiétude ! comme elles ont été étonnées quand elles ne vous ont plus trouvés au retour de la messe où je les accompagnois ! Marie, qui travailloit dans un coin de l’habitation, n’a su nous dire où vous étiez allés. J’allois, je venois autour de l’habitation, ne sachant moi-même de quel côté vous chercher. Enfin j’ai pris vos vieux habits à l’un et à l’autre, je les ai fait flairer à Fidèle ; et sur-le-champ, comme si ce pauvre animal m’eût entendu, il s’est mis à quêter sur vos pas ; il m’a conduit, toujours en remuant la queue, jusqu’à la Rivière Noire. C’est là où j’ai appris d’un habitant que vous lui aviez ramené une négresse marronne, et qu’il vous avoit accordé sa grâce. Mais quelle grâce ! il me l’a montrée attachée, avec une chaîne au pied, à un billot de bois, et avec un collier de fer à trois crochets autour du cou. De là Fidèle, toujours quêtant, m’a mené sur le morne de la Rivière Noire, où il s’est arrêté encore en aboyant de toute sa force ; c’étoit sur le bord d’une source auprès d’un palmiste abattu, et près d’un feu qui fumoit encore. Enfin il m’a conduit ici : nous sommes au pied de la montagne des Trois-Mamelles, et il y a encore quatre bonnes lieues jusque chez nous. Allons, mangez, et prenez des forces. » Il leur présenta aussitôt un gâteau, des fruits, et une grande calebasse remplie d’une liqueur composée d’eau, de vin, de jus de citron, de sucre et de muscade, que leurs mères avoient préparée pour les fortifier et les rafraîchir. Virginie soupira au souvenir de la pauvre esclave, et des inquiétudes de leurs mères. Elle répéta plusieurs fois : « Oh qu’il est difficile de faire le bien ! » Pendant que Paul et elle se rafraîchissoient, Domingue alluma du feu, et ayant cherché dans les rochers un bois tortu qu’on appelle bois de ronde, et qui brûle tout vert en jetant une grande flamme, il en fit un flambeau qu’il alluma ; car il étoit déjà nuit. Mais il éprouva un embarras bien plus grand quand il fallut se mettre en route : Paul et Virginie ne pouvoient plus marcher ; leurs pieds étoient enflés et tout rouges. Domingue ne savoit s’il devoit aller bien loin de là leur chercher du secours, ou passer dans ce lieu la nuit avec eux. « Où est le temps, leur disoit-il, où je vous portois tous deux à la fois dans mes bras ? mais maintenant vous êtes grands, et je suis vieux. » Comme il étoit dans cette perplexité une troupe de Noirs marrons se fit voir à vingt pas de là. Le chef de cette troupe, s’approchant de Paul et de Virginie, leur dit : « Bons petits Blancs, n’ayez pas peur ; nous vous avons vus passer ce matin avec une négresse de la Rivière Noire ; vous alliez demander sa grâce à son mauvais maître : en reconnoissance nous vous reporterons chez vous sur nos épaules. » Alors il fit un signe, et quatre Noirs marrons des plus robustes firent aussitôt un brancard avec des branches d’arbres et des lianes, y placèrent Paul et Virginie, les mirent sur leurs épaules ; et Domingue marchant devant eux avec son flambeau, ils se mirent en route aux cris de joie de toute la troupe, qui les combloit de bénédictions. Virginie attendrie disoit à Paul : « Oh, mon ami ! jamais Dieu ne laisse un bienfoit sans récompense. »

Ils arrivèrent vers le milieu de la nuit au pied de leur Montagne, dont les croupes étoient éclairées de plusieurs feux. À peine ils la montoient qu’ils entendirent des voix qui crioient : « Est-ce vous, mes enfants ? » Ils répondirent avec les Noirs : « Oui, c’est nous »  ; et bientôt ils aperçurent leurs mères et Marie qui venoient au-devant d’eux avec des tisons flambants. « Malheureux enfants, dit madame de la Tour, d’où venez-vous ? dans quelles angoisses vous nous avez jetées ! — Nous venons, dit Virginie, de la Rivière Noire demander la grâce d’une pauvre esclave marronne, à qui j’ai donné ce matin le déjeuner de la maison, parce qu’elle mouroit de faim ; et voilà que les Noirs marrons nous ont ramenés. » Madame de la Tour embrassa sa fille sans pouvoir parler ; et Virginie, qui sentit son visage mouillé des larmes de sa mère, lui dit : « Vous me payez de tout le mal que j’ai souffert » Marguerite, ravie de joie, serroit Paul dans ses bras, et lui disoit : « Et toi aussi, mon fils, tu as fait une bonne action. » Quand elles furent arrivées dans leur case avec leurs enfants, elles donnèrent bien à manger aux Noirs marrons, qui s’en retournèrent dans leurs bois en leur souhaitant toute sorte de prospérités.

Chaque jour étoit pour ces familles un jour de bonheur et de paix. Ni l’envie ni l’ambition ne les tourmentoient. Elles ne désiroient point au dehors une vaine réputation que donne l’intrigue, et qu’ôte la calomnie ; il leur suffisoit d’être à elles-mêmes leurs témoins et leurs juges. Dans cette île, où, comme dans toutes les colonies européennes, on n’est curieux que d’anecdotes malignes, leurs vertus et même leurs noms étoient ignorés ; seulement quand un passant demandoit sur le chemin des Pamplemousses à quelques d’anecdotes malignes, leurs vertus et même leurs noms étoient ignorés ; seulement quand un passant demandoit sur le chemin des Pamplemousses à quelques habitants de la plaine : « Qui est-ce qui demeure là-haut dans ces petites cases ? » ceux-ci répondoient sans les connoître : Ce sont de bonnes gens. » Ainsi des violettes, sous des buissons épineux, exhalent au loin leurs doux parfums, quoiqu’on ne les voie pas.

Elles avoient banni de leurs conversations la médisance, qui, sous une apparence de justice, dispose nécessairement le cœur à la haine ou à la fausseté ; car il est impossible de ne pas haïr les hommes si on les croit méchants, et de vivre avec les méchants si on ne leur cache sa haine sous de fausses apparences de bienveillance. Ainsi la médisance nous oblige d’être mal avec les autres ou avec nous-mêmes. Mais, sans juger des hommes en particulier, elles ne s’entretenoient que des moyens de faire du bien à tous en général ; et quoiqu’elles n’en eussent pas le pouvoir, elles en avoient une volonté perpétuelle qui les remplissoit d’une bienveillance toujours prête à s’étendre au-dehors. En vivant donc dans la solitude, loin d’être sauvages, elles étoient devenues plus humaines. Si l’histoire scandaleuse de la société ne fournissoit point de matière à leurs conversations, celle de la nature les remplissoit de ravissement et de joie. Elles admiroient avec transport le pouvoir d’une providence qui par leurs mains avoit répandu au milieu de ces arides rochers l’abondance, les grâces, les plaisirs purs, simples, et toujours renaissants.

Paul, à l’âge de douze ans, plus robuste et plus intelligent que les Européens à quinze, avoit embelli ce que le Noir Domingue ne faisoit que cultiver. Il alloit avec lui dans les bois voisins déraciner de jeunes plants de citronniers, d’orangers, de tamarins dont la tête ronde est d’un si beau vert, et d’attiers dont le fruit est plein d’une crème sucrée qui a le parfum de la fleur d’orange : il plantoit ces arbres déjà grands autour de cette enceinte. Il y avoit semé des graines d’arbres qui dès la seconde année portent des fleurs ou des fruits, tels que l’agathis, où pendent tout autour, comme les cristaux d’un lustre, de longues grappes de fleurs blanches ; le lilas de Perse, qui élève droit en l’air ses girandoles gris de lin ; le papayer, dont le tronc sans branches, formé en colonne hérissée de melons verts, porte un chapiteau de larges feuilles semblables à celle du figuier.

Il y avoit planté encore des pépins et des noyaux de badamiers, de manguiers, d’avocats, de goyaviers, de jaques et de jameroses. La plupart de ces arbres donnoient déjà à leur jeune maître de l’ombrage et des fruits. Sa main laborieuse avoit répandu la fécondité jusque dans les lieux les plus stériles de cet enclos. Diverses espèces d’aloès, la raquette chargée de fleurs jaunes fouettées de rouge, les cierges épineux, s’élevoient sur les têtes noires des roches, et sembloient vouloir atteindre aux longues lianes, chargées de fleurs bleues ou écarlates, qui pendoient çà et là le long des escarpements de la montagne.

Il avoit disposé ces végétaux de manière qu’on pouvoit jouir de leur vue d’un seul coup d’œil. Il avoit planté au milieu de ce bassin les herbes qui s’élèvent peu, ensuite les arbrisseaux, puis les arbres moyens, et enfin les grands arbres qui en bordoient la circonférence ; de sorte que ce vaste enclos paraissoit de son centre comme un amphithéâtre de verdure, de fruits et de fleurs, renfermant des plantes potagères, des lisières de prairies, et des champs de riz et de blé. Mais en assujettissant ces végétaux à son plan, il ne s’étoit pas écarté de celui de la nature ; guidé par ses indications, il avoit mis dans les lieux élevés ceux dont les semences sont volatiles, et sur le bord des eaux ceux dont les graines sont faites pour flotter : ainsi chaque végétal croissoit dans son site propre et chaque site recevoit de son végétal sa parure naturelle. Les eaux qui descendent du sommet de ces roches formoient au fond du vallon, ici des fontaines, là de larges miroirs qui répétoient au milieu de la verdure les arbres en fleurs, les rochers, et l’azur des cieux.

Malgré la grande irrégularité de ce terrain toutes ces plantations étoient pour la plupart aussi accessibles au toucher qu’à la vue : à la vérité nous l’aidions tous de nos conseils et de nos secours pour en venir à bout. Il avoit pratiqué un sentier qui tournoit autour de ce bassin et dont plusieurs rameaux venoient se rendre de la circonférence au centre. Il avoit tiré parti des lieux les plus raboteux, et accordé par la plus heureuse harmonie la facilité de la promenade avec l’aspérité du sol, et les arbres domestiques avec les sauvages. De cette énorme quantité de pierres roulantes qui embarrasse maintenant ces chemins ainsi que la plupart du terrain de cette île, il avoit formé çà et là des pyramides, dans les assises desquelles il avoit mêlé de la terre et des racines de rosiers, de poincillades, et d’autres arbrisseaux qui se plaisent dans les roches ; en peu de temps ces pyramides sombres et brutes furent couvertes de verdure, ou de l’éclat des plus belles fleurs. Les ravins bordés de vieux arbres inclinés sur leurs bords formoient des souterrains voûtés inaccessibles à la chaleur, où l’on alloit prendre le frais pendant le jour. Un sentier conduisoit dans un bosquet d’arbres sauvages, au centre duquel croissoit à l’abri des vents un arbre domestique chargé de fruits. Là étoit une moisson, ici un verger. Par cette avenue on apercevoit les maisons ; par cette autre, les sommets inaccessibles de la montagne. Sous un bocage touffu de tatamaques entrelacés de lianes on ne distinguoit en plein midi aucun objet ; sur la pointe de ce grand rocher voisin qui sort de la montagne on découvroit tous ceux de cet enclos, avec la mer au loin, où apparaissoit quelquefois un vaisseau qui venoit de l’Europe, ou qui y retournoit. C’étoit sur ce rocher que ces familles se rassembloient le soir, et jouissoient en silence de la fraîcheur de l’air, du parfum des fleurs, du murmure des fontaines, et des dernières harmonies de la lumière et des ombres.

Rien n’étoit plus agréable que les noms donnés à la plupart des retraites charmantes de ce labyrinthe. Ce rocher dont je viens de vous parler, d’où l’on me voyoit venir de bien loin, s’appeloit la Découverte de l’Amitié. Paul et Virginie, dans leurs jeux, y avoient planté un bambou, au haut duquel ils élevoient un petit mouchoir blanc pour signaler mon arrivée dès qu’ils m’apercevoient, ainsi qu’on élève un pavillon sur la montagne voisine, à la vue d’un vaisseau en mer. L’idée me vint de graver une inscription sur la tige de ce roseau. Quelque plaisir que j’aie eu dans mes voyages à voir une statue ou un monument de l’antiquité, j’en ai encore davantage à lire une inscription bien faite ; il me semble alors qu’une voix humaine sorte de la pierre, se fasse entendre à travers les siècles, et s’adressant à l’homme au milieu des déserts, lui dise qu’il n’est pas seul, et que d’autres hommes dans ces mêmes lieux ont senti, pensé, et souffert comme lui : que si cette inscription est de quelque nation ancienne qui ne subsiste plus, elle étend notre âme dans les champs de l’infini, et lui donne le sentiment de son immortalité, en lui montrant qu’une pensée a survécu à la ruine même d’un empire.

J’écrivis donc sur le petit mât de pavillon de Paul et de Virginie ces vers d’Horace :
… Fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,
Obstrictis aliis, praeter iapyga.

« Que les frères d’Hélène, astres charmants comme vous, et que le père des vents vous dirigent, et ne fassent souffler que le zéphyr. »

Je gravai ce vers de Virgile sur l’écorce d’un tatamaque, à l’ombre duquel Paul s’asseyoit quelquefois pour regarder au loin la mer agitée :

Fortunatus et ille deos qui novit agrestes !

« Heureux, mon fils, de ne connoître que les divinités champêtres ! »

Et cet autre, au-dessus de la porte de la cabane de madame de la Tour, qui étoit leur lieu d’assemblée :

At secura quies, et nescia fallere vita.

« Ici est une bonne conscience, et une vie qui ne sait pas tromper. »

Mais Virginie n’approuvoit point mon latin ; elle disoit que ce que j’avois mis au pied de sa girouette étoit trop long et trop savant : « J’eusse mieux aimé, ajoutoit-elle, Toujours agitée, mais constante. — Cette devise, lui répondis-je, conviendroit encore mieux à la vertu. » Ma réflexion la fit rougir.

Ces familles heureuses étendoient leurs âmes sensibles à tout ce qui les environnoit. Elles avoient donné les noms les plus tendres aux objets en apparence les plus indifférents. Un cercle d’orangers, de bananiers et de jameroses plantés autour d’une pelouse, au milieu de laquelle Virginie et Paul alloient quelquefois danser, se nommoit La Concorde. Un vieux arbre, à l’ombre duquel madame de la Tour et Marguerite s’étoient raconté leurs malheurs, s’appeloit Les pleurs essuyés. Elles faisoient porter les noms de Bretagne et de Normandie à de petites portions de terre où elles avoient semé du blé, des fraises et des pois. Domingue et Marie désirant, à l’imitation de leurs maîtresses, se rappeler les lieux de leur naissance en Afrique, appeloient ANGOLA et FOULLEPOINTE deux endroits où croissoit l’herbe dont ils faisoient des paniers, et où ils avoient planté un calebassier. Ainsi, par ces productions de leurs climats, ces familles expatriées entretenoient les douces illusions de leur pays et en calmoient les regrets dans une terre étrangère. Hélas ! j’ai vu s’animer de mille appellations charmantes les arbres, les fontaines, les rochers de ce lieu maintenant si bouleversé, et qui, semblable à un champ de la Grèce, n’offre plus que des ruines et des noms touchants.

Mais de tout ce que renfermoit cette enceinte rien n’étoit plus agréable que ce qu’on appeloit le Repos de Virginie. Au pied du rocher la Découverte de l’Amitié est un enfoncement d’où sort une fontaine, qui forme dès sa source une petite flaque d’eau, au milieu d’un pré d’une herbe fine. Lorsque Marguerite eut mis Paul au monde je lui fis présent d’un coco des Indes qu’on m’avoit donné. Elle planta ce fruit sur le bord de cette flaque d’eau, afin que l’arbre qu’il produiroit servît un jour d’époque à la naissance de son fils. Madame de la Tour, à son exemple, y en planta un autre dans une semblable intention dès qu’elle fut accouchée de Virginie. Il naquit de ces deux fruits deux cocotiers, qui formoient toutes les archives de ces deux familles ; l’un se nommoit l’arbre de Paul, et l’autre, l’arbre de Virginie. Ils crûrent tous deux, dans la même proportion que leurs jeunes maîtres, d’une hauteur un peu inégale, mais qui surpassoit au bout de douze ans celle de leurs cabanes. Déjà ils entrelaçoient leurs palmes, et laissoient pendre leurs jeunes grappes de cocos au-dessus du bassin de la fontaine. Excepté cette plantation on avoit laissé cet enfoncement du rocher tel que la nature l’avoit orné. Sur ses flancs bruns et humides rayonnoient en étoiles vertes et noires de larges capillaires, et flottoient au gré des vents des touffes de scolopendre suspendues comme de longs rubans d’un vert pourpré. Près de là croissoient des lisières de pervenche, dont les fleurs sont presque semblables à celles de la giroflée rouge, et des piments, dont les gousses couleur de sang sont plus éclatantes que le corail. Aux environs, l’herbe de baume, dont les feuilles sont en cœur, et les basilics à odeur de girofle, exhaloient les plus doux parfums. Du haut de l’escarpement de la montagne pendoient des lianes semblables à des draperies flottantes, qui formoient sur les flancs des rochers de grandes courtines de verdure. Les oiseaux de mer, attirés par ces retraites paisibles, y venoient passer la nuit. Au coucher du soleil on y voyoit voler le long des rivages de la mer le corbigeau et l’alouette marine, et au haut des airs la noire frégate, avec l’oiseau blanc du tropique, qui abandonnoient, ainsi que l’astre du jour, les solitudes de l’océan indien. Virginie aimoit à se reposer sur les bords de cette fontaine, décorée d’une pompe à la fois magnifique et sauvage. Souvent elle y venoit laver le linge de la famille à l’ombre des deux cocotiers. Quelquefois elle y menoit paître ses chèvres. Pendant qu’elle préparoit des fromages avec leur lait, elle se plaisoit à les voir brouter les capillaires sur les flancs escarpés de la roche, et se tenir en l’air sur une de ses corniches comme sur un piédestal. Paul, voyant que ce lieu étoit aimé de Virginie, y apporta de la forêt voisine des nids de toute sorte d’oiseaux. Les pères et les mères de ces oiseaux suivirent leurs petits, et vinrent s’établir dans cette nouvelle colonie. Virginie leur distribuoit de temps en temps des grains de riz, de maïs et de millet : dès qu’elle paraissoit, les merles siffleurs, les bengalis, dont le ramage est si doux, les cardinaux, dont le plumage est couleur de feu, quittaient leurs buissons ; des perruches vertes comme des émeraudes descendoient des lataniers voisins ; des perdrix accouroient sous l’herbe : tous s’avançoient pêle-mêle jusqu’à ses pieds comme des poules. Paul et elle s’amusoient avec transport de leurs jeux, de leurs appétits, et de leurs amours.

Aimables enfants, vous passiez ainsi dans l’innocence vos premiers jours en vous exerçant aux bienfaits ! Combien de fois dans ce lieu vos mères, vous serrant dans leurs bras, bénissoient le ciel de la consolation que vous prépariez à leur vieillesse, et de vous voir entrer dans la vie sous de si heureux auspices ! Combien de fois, à l’ombre de ces rochers, ai-je partagé avec elles vos repas champêtres qui n’avoient coûté la vie à aucun animal ! des calebasses pleines de lait, des œufs frais, des gâteaux de riz sur des feuilles de bananier, des corbeilles chargées de patates, de mangues, d’oranges, de grenades, de bananes, d’attes, d’ananas, offroient à la fois les mets les plus sains, les couleurs les plus gaies, et les sucs les plus agréables.

La conversation étoit aussi douce et aussi innocente que ces festins : Paul y parloit souvent des travaux du jour et de ceux du lendemain. Il méditoit toujours quelque chose d’utile pour la société. Ici les sentiers n’étoient pas commodes ; là on étoit mal assis ; ces jeunes berceaux ne donnoient pas assez d’ombrage ; Virginie seroit mieux là.

Dans la saison pluvieuse ils passoient le jour tous ensemble dans la case, maîtres et serviteurs, occupés à faire des nattes d’herbes et des paniers de bambou. On voyoit rangés dans le plus grand ordre aux parois de la muraille des râteaux, des haches, des bêches ; et auprès de ces instruments de l’agriculture les productions qui en étoient les fruits, des sacs de riz, des gerbes de blé, et des régimes de bananes. La délicatesse s’y joignoit toujours à l’abondance. Virginie, instruite par Marguerite et par sa mère, y préparoit des sorbets et des cordiaux avec le jus des cannes à sucre, des citrons et des cédrats.

La nuit venue, ils soupoient à la lueur d’une lampe ; ensuite madame de la Tour ou Marguerite racontoit quelques histoires de voyageurs égarés la nuit dans les bois de l’Europe infestés de voleurs, ou le naufrage de quelque vaisseau jeté par la tempête sur les rochers d’une île déserte. À ces récits les âmes sensibles de leurs enfants s’enflammoient ; ils prioient le ciel de leur faire la grâce d’exercer quelque jour l’hospitalité envers de semblables malheureux. Cependant les deux familles se séparoient pour aller prendre du repos, dans l’impatience de se revoir le lendemain. Quelquefois elles s’endormoient au bruit de la pluie qui tomboit par torrents sur la couverture de leurs cases, ou à celui des vents qui leur apportoient le murmure lointain des flots qui se brisoient sur le rivage. Elles bénissoient Dieu de leur sécurité personnelle, dont le sentiment redoubloit par celui du danger éloigné.

De temps en temps madame de la Tour lisoit publiquement quelque histoire touchante de l’Ancien ou du Nouveau Testament. Ils raisonnoient peu sur ces livres sacrés ; car leur théologie étoit toute en sentiment, comme celle de la nature, et leur morale toute en action, comme celle de l’Evangile. Ils n’avoient point de jours destinés aux plaisirs et d’autres à la tristesse. Chaque jour étoit pour eux un jour de fête, et tout ce qui les environnoit un temple divin, où ils admiroient sans cesse une Intelligence infinie, toute-puissante, et amie des hommes ; ce sentiment de confiance dans le pouvoir suprême les remplissoit de consolation pour le passé, de courage pour le présent, et d’espérance pour l’avenir. Voilà comme ces femmes, forcées par le malheur de rentrer dans la nature, avoient développé en elles-mêmes et dans leurs enfants ces sentiments que donne la nature pour nous empêcher de tomber dans le malheur.

Mais comme il s’élève quelquefois dans l’âme la mieux réglée des nuages qui la troublent, quand quelque membre de leur société paraissoit triste, tous les autres se réunissoient autour de lui, et l’enlevoient aux pensées amères, plus par des sentiments que par des réflexions. Chacun y employoit son caractère particulier ; Marguerite, une gaieté vive ; madame de la Tour, une théologie douce ; Virginie, des caresses tendres ; Paul, de la franchise et de la cordialité ; Marie et Domingue même venoient à son secours. Ils s’affligeoient s’ils le voyoient affligé, et ils pleuroient s’ils le voyoient pleurer. Ainsi des plantes faibles s’entrelacent ensemble pour résister aux ouragans.

Dans la belle saison ils alloient tous les dimanches à la messe à l’église des Pamplemousses dont vous voyez le clocher là-bas dans la plaine. Il y venoit des habitants riches, en palanquin, qui s’empressèrent plusieurs fois de faire la connoissance de ces familles si unies, et de les inviter à des parties de plaisir. Mais elles repoussèrent toujours leurs offres avec honnêteté et respect, persuadées que les gens puissants ne recherchent les faibles que pour avoir des complaisants, et qu’on ne peut être complaisant qu’en flattant les passions d’autrui, bonnes et mauvaises. D’un autre côté elles n’évitoient pas avec moins de soin l’accointance des petits habitants pour l’ordinaire jaloux, médisants et grossiers. Elles passèrent d’abord auprès des uns pour timides, et auprès des autres pour fières ; mais leur conduite réservée étoit accompagnée de marques de politesse si obligeantes, surtout envers les misérables, qu’elles acquirent insensiblement le respect des riches et la confiance des pauvres.

Après la messe on venoit souvent les requérir de quelque bon office. C’étoit une personne affligée qui leur demandoit des conseils, ou un enfant qui les prioit de passer chez sa mère malade dans un des quartiers voisins. Elles portoient toujours avec elles quelques recettes utiles aux maladies ordinaires aux habitants, et elles y joignoient la bonne grâce, qui donne tant de prix aux petits services. Elles réussissoient surtout à bannir les peines de l’esprit, si intolérables dans la solitude et dans un corps infirme. Madame de la Tour parloit avec tant de confiance de la Divinité que le malade en l’écoutant la croyoit présente. Virginie revenoit bien souvent de là les yeux humides de larmes, mais le cœur rempli de joie, car elle avoit eu l’occasion de faire du bien. C’étoit elle qui préparoit d’avance les remèdes nécessaires aux malades, et qui les leur présentoit avec une grâce ineffable. Après ces visites d’humanité, elles prolongeoient quelquefois leur chemin par la vallée de la Montagne Longue jusque chez moi, où je les attendois à dîner sur les bords de la petite rivière qui coule dans mon voisinage. Je me procurois pour ces occasions quelques bouteilles de vin vieux, afin d’augmenter la gaieté de nos repas indiens par ces douces et cordiales productions de l’Europe. D’autres fois nous nous donnions rendez-vous sur les bords de la mer, à l’embouchure de quelques autres petites rivières, qui ne sont guère ici que de grands ruisseaux : nous y apportions de l’habitation des provisions végétales que nous joignions à celles que la mer nous fournissoit en abondance. Nous pêchions sur ses rivages des cabots, des polypes, des rougets, des langoustes, des chevrettes, des crabes, des oursins, des huîtres, et des coquillages de toute espèce. Les sites les plus terribles nous procuroient souvent les plaisirs les plus tranquilles. Quelquefois, assis sur un rocher, à l’ombre d’un veloutier, nous voyions les flots du large venir se briser à nos pieds avec un horrible fracas. Paul, qui nageoit d’ailleurs comme un poisson, s’avançoit quelquefois sur les récifs au-devant des lames, puis à leur approche il fuyoit sur le rivage devant leurs grandes volutes écumeuses et mugissantes qui le poursuivoient bien avant sur la grève. Mais Virginie à cette vue jetoit des cris perçants, et disoit que ces jeux-là lui faisoient grand-peur.

Nos repas étoient suivis des chants et des danses de ces deux jeunes gens. Virginie chantoit le bonheur de la vie champêtre, et les malheurs des gens de mer que l’avarice porte à naviguer sur un élément furieux, plutôt que de cultiver la terre, qui donne paisiblement tant de biens. Quelquefois, à la manière des Noirs, elle exécutoit avec Paul une pantomime. La pantomime est le premier langage de l’homme ; elle est connue de toutes les nations ; elle est si naturelle et si expressive que les enfants des Blancs ne tardent pas à l’apprendre dès qu’ils ont vu ceux des Noirs s’y exercer. Virginie se rappelant, dans les lectures que lui faisoit sa mère, les histoires qui l’avoient le plus touchée, en rendoit les principaux événements avec beaucoup de naïveté. Tantôt, au son du tam-tam de Domingue, elle se présentoit sur la pelouse, portant une cruche sur sa tête, elle s’avançoit avec timidité à la source d’une fontaine voisine pour y puiser de l’eau. Domingue et Marie, représentant les bergers de Madian, lui en défendoient l’approche et feignoient de la repousser. Paul accouroit à son secours, battoit les bergers, remplissoit la cruche de Virginie, et en la lui posant sur la tête il lui mettoit en même temps une couronne de fleurs rouges de pervenche qui relevoit la blancheur de son teint. Alors, me prêtant à leurs jeux, je me chargeais du personnage de Raguel, et j’accordois à Paul ma fille Séphora en mariage.

Une autre fois elle représentoit l’infortunée Ruth qui retourne veuve et pauvre dans son pays, où elle se trouve étrangère après une longue absence. Domingue et Marie contrefaisoient les moissonneurs. Virginie feignoit de glaner çà et là sur leurs pas quelques épis de blé. Paul, imitant la gravité d’un patriarche, l’interrogeoit ; elle répondoit en tremblant à ses questions. Bientôt ému de pitié il accordoit l’hospitalité à l’innocence, et un asile à l’infortune ; il remplissoit le tablier de Virginie de toutes sortes de provisions, et l’amenoit devant nous, comme devant les anciens de la ville, en déclarant qu’il la prenoit en mariage malgré son indigence. Madame de la Tour, à cette scène, venant à se rappeler l’abandon où l’avoient laissée ses propres parents, son veuvage, la bonne réception que lui avoit faite Marguerite, suivie maintenant de l’espoir d’un mariage heureux entre leurs enfants, ne pouvoit s’empêcher de pleurer ; et ce souvenir confus de maux et de biens nous faisoit verser à tous des larmes de douleur et de joie.

Ces drames étoient rendus avec tant de vérité qu’on se croyoit transporté dans les champs de la Syrie ou de la Palestine. Nous ne manquions point de décorations, d’illuminations et d’orchestre convenables à ce spectacle. Le lieu de la scène étoit pour l’ordinaire au carrefour d’une forêt dont les percés formoient autour de nous plusieurs arcades de feuillage : nous étions à leur centre abrités de la chaleur pendant toute la journée ; mais quand le soleil étoit descendu à l’horizon, ses rayons, brisés par les troncs des arbres, divergeoient dans les ombres de la forêt en longues gerbes lumineuses qui produisoient le plus majestueux effet. Quelquefois son disque tout entier paraissoit à l’extrémité d’une avenue et la rendoit toute étincelante de lumière. Le feuillage des arbres, éclairés en dessous de ses rayons safranés, brilloit des feux de la topaze et de l’émeraude ; leurs troncs mousseux et bruns paraissoient changés en colonnes de bronze antique ; et les oiseaux déjà retirés en silence sous la sombre feuillée pour y passer la nuit, surpris de revoir une seconde aurore, saluoient tous à la fois l’astre du jour par mille et mille chansons.

La nuit nous surprenoit bien souvent dans ces fêtes champêtres ; mais la pureté de l’air et la douceur du climat nous permettoient de dormir sous un ajoupa, au milieu des bois, sans craindre d’ailleurs les voleurs ni de près ni de loin. Chacun le lendemain retournoit dans sa case, et la retrouvoit dans l’état où il l’avoit laissée. Il y avoit alors tant de bonne foi et de simplicité dans cette île sans commerce, que les portes de beaucoup de maisons ne fermoient point à la clef, et qu’une serrure étoit un objet de curiosité pour plusieurs Créoles.

Mais il y avoit dans l’année des jours qui étoient pour Paul et Virginie des jours de plus grandes réjouissances ; c’étoient les fêtes de leurs mères. Virginie ne manquoit pas la veille de pétrir et de cuire des gâteaux de farine de froment, qu’elle envoyoit à de pauvres familles de Blancs, nées dans l’île, qui n’avoient jamais mangé de pain d’Europe, et qui sans aucun secours de Noirs, réduites à vivre de manioc au milieu des bois, n’avoient pour supporter la pauvreté ni la stupidité qui accompagne l’esclavage, ni le courage qui vient de l’éducation. Ces gâteaux étoient les seuls présents que Virginie pût faire de l’aisance de l’habitation ; mais elle y joignoit une bonne grâce qui leur donnoit un grand prix. D’abord c’étoit Paul qui étoit chargé de les porter lui-même à ces familles, et elles s’engageoient en les recevant de venir le lendemain passer la journée chez madame de la Tour et Marguerite. On voyoit alors arriver une mère de famille avec deux ou trois misérables filles, jaunes, maigres, et si timides qu’elles n’osaient lever les yeux. Virginie les mettoit bientôt à leur aise ; elle leur servoit des rafraîchissements, dont elle relevoit la bonté par quelque circonstance particulière qui en augmentoit selon elle l’agrément : cette liqueur avoit été préparée par Marguerite, cette autre par sa mère ; son frère avoit cueilli lui-même ce fruit au haut d’un arbre. Elle engageoit Paul à les faire danser. Elle ne les quittoit point qu’elle ne les vît contentes et satisfaites ; elle vouloit qu’elles fussent joyeuses de la joie de sa famille. « On ne fait son bonheur, disoit-elle, qu’en s’occupant de celui des autres. » Quand elles s’en retournoient elle les engageoit d’emporter ce qui paraissoit leur avoir fait plaisir, couvrant la nécessité d’agréer ses présents du prétexte de leur nouveauté ou de leur singularité. Si elle remarquoit trop de délabrement dans leurs habits, elle choisissoit, avec l’agrément de sa mère, quelques-uns des siens, et elle chargeoit Paul d’aller secrètement les déposer à la porte de leurs cases. Ainsi elle faisoit le bien, à l’exemple de la Divinité, cachant la bienfaitrice, et montrant le bienfoit.

Vous autres Européens, dont l’esprit se remplit dès l’enfance de tant de préjugés contraires au bonheur, vous ne pouvez concevoir que la nature puisse donner tant de lumières et de plaisirs. Votre âme, circonscrite dans une petite sphère de connoissances humaines, atteint bientôt le terme de ses jouissances artificielles : mais la nature et le cœur sont inépuisables. Paul et Virginie n’avoient ni horloges, ni almanachs, ni livres de chronologie, d’histoire, et de philosophie. Les périodes de leur vie se régloient sur celles de la nature. Ils connoissoient les heures du jour par l’ombre des arbres ; les saisons, par les temps où ils donnent leurs fleurs ou leurs fruits ; et les années, par le nombre de leurs récoltes. Ces douces images répandoient les plus grands charmes dans leurs conversations. « Il est temps de dîner, disoit Virginie à la famille, les ombres des bananiers sont à leurs pieds »  ; ou bien : « La nuit s’approche, les tamarins ferment leurs feuilles. — Quand viendrez-vous nous voir ? lui disoient quelques amies du voisinage. — Aux cannes de sucre, répondoit Virginie. — Votre visite nous sera encore plus douce et plus agréable, reprenoient ces jeunes filles. » Quand on l’interrogeoit sur son âge et sur celui de Paul : « Mon frère, disoit-elle, est de l’âge du grand cocotier de la fontaine, et moi de celui du plus petit. Les manguiers ont donné douze fois leurs fruits, et les orangers vingt-quatre fois leurs fleurs depuis que je suis au monde. » Leur vie sembloit attachée à celle des arbres comme celle des faunes et des dryades : ils ne connoissoient d’autres époques historiques que celles de la vie de leurs mères, d’autre chronologie que celle de leurs vergers, et d’autre philosophie que de faire du bien à tout le monde, et de se résigner à la volonté de Dieu.

Après tout qu’avoient besoin ces jeunes gens d’être riches et savants à notre manière ? leurs besoins et leur ignorance ajoutoient encore à leur félicité. Il n’y avoit point de jour qu’ils ne se communiquassent quelques secours ou quelques lumières : oui, des lumières ; et quand il s’y seroit mêlé quelques erreurs, l’homme pur n’en a point de dangereuses à craindre. Ainsi croissoient ces deux enfants de la nature. Aucun souci n’avoit ridé leur front, aucune intempérance n’avoit corrompu leur sang, aucune passion malheureuse n’avoit dépravé leur cœur : l’amour, l’innocence, la piété, développoient chaque jour la beauté de leur âme en grâces ineffables, dans leurs traits, leurs attitudes et leurs mouvements. Au matin de la Vie, ils en avoient toute la fraîcheur : tels dans le jardin d’Eden parurent nos premiers parents, lorsque, sortant des mains de Dieu, ils se virent, s’approchèrent, et conversèrent d’abord comme frère et comme sœur. Virginie, douce, modeste, confiante comme Ève ; et Paul, semblable à Adam, ayant la taille d’un homme avec la simplicité d’un enfant.

Quelquefois seul avec elle (il me l’a mille fois raconté), il lui disoit au retour de ses travaux : « Lorsque je suis fatigué ta vue me délasse. Quand du haut de la montagne je t’aperçois au fond de ce vallon, tu me parois au milieu de nos vergers comme un bouton de rose. Si tu marches vers la maison de nos mères, la perdrix qui court vers ses petits a un corsage moins beau et une démarche moins légère. Quoique je te perde de vue à travers les arbres, je n’ai pas besoin de te voir pour te retrouver ; quelque chose de toi que je ne puis dire reste pour moi dans l’air où tu passes, sur l’herbe où tu t’assieds. Lorsque je t’approche, tu ravis tous mes sens. L’azur du ciel est moins beau que le bleu de tes yeux ; le chant des bengalis, moins doux que le son de ta voix. Si je te touche seulement du bout du doigt, tout mon corps frémit de plaisir. Souviens-toi du jour où nous passâmes à travers les cailloux roulants de la rivière des Trois-Mamelles. En arrivant sur ses bords j’étois déjà bien fatigué ; mais quand je t’eus prise sur mon dos il me sembloit que j’avois des ailes comme un oiseau. Dis-moi par quel charme tu as pu m’enchanter. Est-ce par ton esprit ? mais nos mères en ont plus que nous deux. Est-ce par tes caresses ? mais elles m’embrassent plus souvent que toi. Je crois que c’est par ta bonté. Je n’oublierai jamais que tu as marché nu-pieds jusqu’à la Rivière Noire pour demander la grâce d’une pauvre esclave fugitive. Tiens, ma bien-aimée, prends cette branche fleurie de citronnier que j’ai cueillie dans la forêt ; tu la mettras la nuit près de ton lit. Mange ce rayon de miel ; je l’ai pris pour toi au haut d’un rocher. Mais auparavant repose-toi sur mon sein, et je serai délassé. »

Virginie lui répondoit : « Ô mon frère ! les rayons du soleil au matin, au haut de ces rochers, me donnent moins de joie que ta présence. J’aime bien ma mère, j’aime bien la tienne ; mais quand elles t’appellent mon fils je les aime encore davantage. Les caresses qu’elles te font me sont plus sensibles que celles que j’en reçois. Tu me demandes pourquoi tu m’aimes ; mais tout ce qui a été élevé ensemble s’aime. Vois nos oiseaux ; élevés dans les mêmes nids, ils s’aiment comme nous ; ils sont toujours ensemble comme nous. Ecoute comme ils s’appellent et se répondent d’un arbre à l’autre : de même quand l’écho me fait entendre les airs que tu joues sur ta flûte, au haut de la montagne, j’en répète les paroles au fond de ce vallon. Tu m’es cher, surtout depuis le jour où tu voulois te battre pour moi contre le maître de l’esclave. Depuis ce temps-là, je me suis dit bien des fois : Ah ! mon frère a un bon cœur ; sans lui je serois morte d’effroi. Je prie Dieu tous les jours pour ma mère, pour la tienne, pour toi, pour nos pauvres serviteurs ; mais quand je prononce ton nom il me semble que ma dévotion augmente. Je demande si instamment à Dieu qu’il ne t’arrive aucun mal ! Pourquoi vas-tu si loin et si haut me chercher des fruits et des fleurs ? n’en avons-nous pas assez dans le jardin ? Comme te voilà fatigué ! tu es tout en nage. » Et avec son petit mouchoir blanc elle lui essuyoit le front et les joues, et elle lui donnoit plusieurs baisers.

Cependant depuis quelque temps Virginie se sentoit agitée d’un mal inconnu. Ses beaux yeux bleus se marbroient de noir ; son teint jaunissoit ; une langueur universelle abattoit son corps. La sérénité n’étoit plus sur son front, ni le sourire sur ses lèvres. On la voyoit tout à coup gaie sans joie, et triste sans chagrin. Elle fuyoit ses jeux innocents, ses doux travaux, et la société de sa famille bien-aimée. Elle erroit çà et là dans les lieux les plus solitaires de l’habitation, cherchant partout du repos, et ne le trouvant nulle part. Quelquefois, à la vue de Paul, elle alloit vers lui en folâtrant ; puis tout à coup, près de l’aborder, un embarras subit la saisissoit ; un rouge vif coloroit ses joues pâles, et ses yeux n’osaient plus s’arrêter sur les siens. Paul lui disoit : « La verdure couvre ces rochers, nos oiseaux chantent quand ils te voient ; tout est gai autour de toi, toi seule est triste. » Et il cherchoit à la ranimer en l’embrassant ; mais elle détournoit la tête, et fuyoit tremblante vers sa mère. L’infortunée se sentoit troublée par les caresses de son frère. Paul ne comprenoit rien à des caprices si nouveaux et si étranges. Un mal n’arrive guère seul.

Un de ces étés qui désolent de temps à autre les terres situées entre les tropiques vint étendre ici ses ravages. C’étoit vers la fin de décembre, lorsque le soleil au capricorne échauffe pendant trois semaines l’Ile de France de ses feux verticaux. Le vent du sud-est qui y règne presque toute l’année n’y souffloit plus. De longs tourbillons de poussière s’élevoient sur les chemins, et restoient suspendus en l’air. La terre se fendoit de toutes parts ; l’herbe étoit brûlée ; des exhalaisons chaudes sortoient du flanc des montagnes, et la plupart de leurs ruisseaux étoient desséchés. Aucun nuage ne venoit du côté de la mer. Seulement pendant le jour des vapeurs rousses s’élevoient de dessus ses plaines, et paraissoient au coucher du soleil comme les flammes d’un incendie. La nuit même n’apportoit aucun rafraîchissement à l’atmosphère embrasée. L’orbe de la lune, tout rouge, se levoit, dans un horizon embrumé, d’une grandeur démesurée. Les troupeaux abattus sur les flancs des collines, le cou tendu vers le ciel, aspirant l’air, faisoient retentir les vallons de tristes mugissements. Le Cafre même qui les conduisoit se couchoit sur la terre pour y trouver de la fraîcheur ; mais partout le sol étoit brûlant, et l’air étouffant retentissoit du bourdonnement des insectes qui cherchoient à se désaltérer dans le sang des hommes et des animaux.

Dans une de ces nuits ardentes, Virginie sentit redoubler tous les symptômes de son mal. Elle se levoit, elle s’asseyoit, elle se recouchoit, et ne trouvoit dans aucune attitude ni le sommeil ni le repos. Elle s’achemine, à la clarté de la lune, vers sa fontaine ; elle en aperçoit la source qui, malgré la sécheresse, coulait encore en filets d’argent sur les flancs bruns du rocher. Elle se plonge dans son bassin. D’abord la fraîcheur ranime ses sens, et mille souvenirs agréables se présentent à son esprit. Elle se rappelle que dans son enfance sa mère et Marguerite s’amusoient à la baigner avec Paul dans ce même lieu ; que Paul ensuite, réservant ce bain pour elle seule, en avoit creusé le lit, couvert le fond de sable, et semé sur ses bords des herbes aromatiques. Elle entrevoit dans l’eau, sur ses bras nus et sur son sein, les reflets des deux palmiers plantés à la naissance de son frère et à la sienne, qui entrelaçoient au-dessus de sa tête leurs rameaux verts et leurs jeunes cocos. Elle pense à l’amitié de Paul, plus douce que les parfums, plus pure que l’eau des fontaines, plus forte que les palmiers unis ; et elle soupire. Elle songe à la nuit, à la solitude, et un feu dévorant la saisit. Aussitôt elle sort, effrayée de ces dangereux ombrages et de ces eaux plus brûlantes que les soleils de la zone torride. Elle court auprès de sa mère chercher un appui contre elle-même. Plusieurs fois, voulant lui raconter ses peines, elle lui pressa les mains dans les siennes ; plusieurs fois elle fut près de prononcer le nom de Paul, mais son cœur oppressé laissa sa langue sans expression, et posant sa tête sur le sein maternel elle ne put que l’inonder de ses larmes.

Madame de la Tour pénétroit bien la cause du mal de sa fille, mais elle n’osoit elle-même lui en parler. « Mon enfant, lui disoit-elle, adresse-toi à Dieu, qui dispose à son gré de la santé et de la vie. Il t’éprouve aujourd’hui pour te récompenser demain. Songe que nous ne sommes sur la terre que pour exercer la vertu. »

Cependant ces chaleurs excessives élevèrent de l’océan des vapeurs qui couvrirent l’île comme un vaste parasol. Les sommets des montagnes les rassembloient autour d’eux, et de longs sillons de feu sortoient de temps en temps de leurs pitons embrumés. Bientôt des tonnerres affreux firent retentir de leurs éclats les bois, les plaines et les vallons ; des pluies épouvantables, semblables à des cataractes, tombèrent du ciel. Des torrents écumeux se précipitoient le long des flancs de cette montagne : le fond de ce bassin étoit devenu une mer ; le plateau où sont assises les cabanes, une petite île ; et l’entrée de ce vallon, une écluse par où sortoient pêle- mêle avec les eaux mugissantes les terres, les arbres et les rochers.

Toute la famille tremblante prioit Dieu dans la case de madame de la Tour, dont le toit craquoit horriblement par l’effort des vents. Quoique la porte et les contrevents en fussent bien fermés, tous les objets s’y distinguoient à travers les jointures de la charpente, tant les éclairs étoient vifs et fréquents. L’intrépide Paul, suivi de Domingue, alloit d’une case à l’autre malgré la fureur de la tempête, assurant ici une paroi avec un arc-boutant, et enfonçant là un pieu : il ne rentroit que pour consoler la famille par l’espoir prochain du retour du beau temps. En effet sur le soir la pluie cessa ; le vent alizé du sud-est reprit son cours ordinaire ; les nuages orageux furent jetés vers le nord-ouest, et le soleil couchant parut à l’horizon.

Le premier désir de Virginie fut de revoir le lieu de son repos. Paul s’approcha d’elle d’un air timide, et lui présenta son bras pour l’aider à marcher. Elle l’accepta en souriant, et ils sortirent ensemble de la case. L’air étoit frais et sonore. Des fumées blanches s’élevoient sur les croupes de la montagne sillonnée çà et là de l’écume des torrents qui tarissoient de tous côtés. Pour le jardin, il étoit tout bouleversé par d’affreux ravins ; la plupart des arbres fruitiers avoient leurs racines en haut ; de grands amas de sable couvroient les lisières des prairies, et avoient comblé le bain de Virginie. Cependant les deux cocotiers étoient debout et bien verdoyants ; mais il n’y avoit plus aux environs ni gazons, ni berceaux, ni oiseaux, excepté quelques bengalis qui, sur la pointe des rochers voisins, déploroient par des chants plaintifs la perte de leurs petits.

À la vue de cette désolation, Virginie dit à Paul : « Vous aviez apporté ici des oiseaux, l’ouragan les a tués. Vous aviez planté ce jardin, il est détruit. Tout périt sur la terre ; il n’y a que le ciel qui ne change point. » Paul lui répondit : « Que ne puis-je vous donner quelque chose du ciel ! mais je ne possède rien, même sur la terre. » Virginie reprit, en rougissant : « Vous avez à vous le portrait de saint Paul. » À peine eut-elle parlé qu’il courut le chercher dans la case de sa mère. Ce portrait étoit une petite miniature représentant l’ermite Paul. Marguerite y avoit une grande dévotion ; elle l’avoit porté longtemps suspendu à son cou étant fille ; ensuite, devenue mère, elle l’avoit mis à celui de son enfant. Il étoit même arrivé qu’étant enceinte de lui, et délaissée de tout le monde, à force de contempler l’image de ce bienheureux solitaire, son fruit en avoit contracté quelque ressemblance ; ce qui l’avoit décidée à lui en faire porter le nom, et à lui donner pour patron un saint qui avoit passé sa vie loin des hommes, qui l’avoient abusée, puis abandonnée. Virginie, en recevant ce petit portrait des mains de Paul, lui dit d’un ton ému : « Mon frère, il ne me sera jamais enlevé tant que je vivrai, et je n’oublierai jamais que tu m’as donné la seule chose que tu possèdes au monde. » À ce ton d’amitié, à ce retour inespéré de familiarité et de tendresse, Paul voulut l’embrasser ; mais aussi légère qu’un oiseau elle lui échappa, et le laissa hors de lui, ne concevant rien à une conduite si extraordinaire.

Cependant Marguerite disoit à madame de la Tour : « Pourquoi ne marions-nous pas nos enfants ? Ils ont l’un pour l’autre une passion extrême dont mon fils ne s’aperçoit pas encore. Lorsque la nature lui aura parlé, en vain nous veillons sur eux, tout est à craindre. » Madame de la Tour lui répondit : « Ils sont trop jeunes et trop pauvres. Quel chagrin pour nous si Virginie mettoit au monde des enfants malheureux, qu’elle n’auroit peut-être pas la force d’élever ! Ton Noir Domingue est bien cassé ; Marie est infirme. Moi-même, chère amie, depuis quinze ans je me sens fort affaiblie. On vieillit promptement dans les pays chauds, et encore plus vite dans le chagrin. Paul est notre unique espérance. Attendons que l’âge ait formé son tempérament, et qu’il puisse nous soutenir par son travail. À présent, tu le sais, nous n’avons guère que le nécessaire de chaque jour. Mais en faisant passer Paul dans l’Inde pour un peu de temps, le commerce lui fournira de quoi acheter quelque esclave : et à son retour ici nous le marierons à Virginie ; car je crois que personne ne peut rendre ma chère fille aussi heureuse que ton fils Paul. Nous en parlerons à notre voisin. »

En effet ces dames me consultèrent, et je fus de leur avis. « Les mers de l’Inde sont belles, leur dis-je. En prenant une saison favorable pour passer d’ici aux Indes, c’est un voyage de six semaines au plus, et d’autant de temps pour en revenir. Nous ferons dans notre quartier une pacotille à Paul ; car j’ai des voisins qui l’aiment beaucoup. Quand nous ne lui donnerions que du coton brut, dont nous ne faisons aucun usage faute de moulins pour l’éplucher ; du bois d’ébène, si commun ici qu’il sert au chauffage, et quelques résines qui se perdent dans nos bois : tout cela se vend assez bien aux Indes, et nous est fort inutile ici. »

Je me chargeai de demander à M. de la Bourdonnais une permission d’embarquement pour ce voyage ; et avant tout je voulus en prévenir Paul. Mais quel fut mon étonnement lorsque ce jeune homme me dit avec un bon sens fort au-dessus de son âge : « Pourquoi voulez-vous que je quitte ma famille pour je ne sais quel projet de fortune ? Y a-t-il un commerce au monde plus avantageux que la culture d’un champ qui rend quelquefois cinquante et cent pour un ? Si nous voulons faire le commerce, ne pouvons-nous pas le faire en portant notre superflu d’ici à la ville, sans que j’aille courir aux Indes ? Nos mères me disent que Domingue est vieux et cassé ; mais moi je suis jeune, et je me renforce chaque jour. Il n’a qu’à leur arriver pendant mon absence quelque accident, surtout à Virginie qui est déjà souffrante. Oh non, non ! je ne saurois me résoudre à les quitter. »

Sa réponse me jeta dans un grand embarras ; car madame de la Tour ne m’avoit pas caché l’état de Virginie, et le désir qu’elle avoit de gagner quelques années sur l’âge de ces jeunes gens en les éloignant l’un de l’autre. C’étoient des motifs que je n’osois même faire soupçonner à Paul.

Sur ces entrefaites un vaisseau arrivé de France apporta à madame de la Tour une lettre de sa tante. La crainte de la mort, sans laquelle les cœurs durs ne seroient jamais sensibles, l’avoit frappée. Elle sortoit d’une grande maladie dégénérée en langueur, et que l’âge rendoit incurable. Elle mandoit à sa nièce de repasser en France ; ou, si sa santé ne lui permettoit pas de faire un si long voyage, elle lui enjoignoit d’y envoyer Virginie, à laquelle elle destinoit une bonne éducation, un parti à la cour, et la donation de tous ses biens. Elle attachoit, disoit-elle, le retour de ses bontés à l’exécution de ses ordres.

À peine cette lettre fut lue dans la famille qu’elle y répandit la consternation. Domingue et Marie se mirent à pleurer. Paul, immobile d’étonnement, paraissoit prêt à se mettre en colère. Virginie, les yeux fixés sur sa mère, n’osoit proférer un mot. « Pourriez-vous nous quitter maintenant ? dit Marguerite à madame de la Tour. — Non, mon amie ; non, mes enfants, reprit madame de la Tour : je ne vous quitterai point. J’ai vécu avec vous, et c’est avec vous que je veux mourir. Je n’ai connu le bonheur que dans votre amitié. Si ma santé est dérangée, d’anciens chagrins en sont cause. J’ai été blessée au cœur par la dureté de mes parents et par la perte de mon cher époux. Mais depuis, j’ai goûté plus de consolation et de félicité avec vous, sous ces pauvres cabanes, que jamais les richesses de ma famille ne m’en ont fait même espérer dans ma patrie. »

À ce discours des larmes de joie coulèrent de tous les yeux. Paul, serrant madame de la Tour dans ses bras, lui dit : « Je ne vous quitterai pas non plus ; je n’irai point aux Indes. Nous travaillerons tous pour vous, chère maman ; rien ne vous manquera jamais avec nous. » Mais de toute la société la personne qui témoigna le moins de joie, et qui y fut la plus sensible, fut Virginie. Elle parut le reste du jour d’une gaieté douce, et le retour de sa tranquillité mit le comble à la satisfaction générale.

Le lendemain, au lever du soleil, comme ils venoient de faire tous ensemble, suivant leur coutume, la prière du matin qui précédoit le déjeuner, Domingue les avertit qu’un monsieur à cheval, suivi de deux esclaves, s’avançoit vers l’habitation. C’étoit M. de la Bourdonnais. Il entra dans la case où toute la famille étoit à table. Virginie venoit de servir, suivant l’usage du pays, du café et du riz cuit à l’eau. Elle y avoit joint des patates chaudes et des bananes fraîches. Il y avoit pour toute vaisselle des moitiés de calebasses, et pour linge des feuilles de bananier. Le gouverneur témoigna d’abord quelque étonnement de la pauvreté de cette demeure. Ensuite, s’adressant à madame de la Tour, il lui dit que les affaires générales l’empêchoient quelquefois de songer aux particulières ; mais qu’elle avoit bien des droits sur lui. « Vous avez, ajouta-t-il, madame, une tante de qualité et fort riche à Paris, qui vous réserve sa fortune, et vous attend auprès d’elle. » Madame de la Tour répondit au gouverneur que sa santé altérée ne lui permettoit pas d’entreprendre un si long voyage. « Au moins, reprit M. de la Bourdonnais, pour mademoiselle votre fille, si jeune et si aimable, vous ne sauriez sans injustice la priver d’une si grande succession. Je ne vous cache pas que votre tante a employé l’autorité pour la faire venir auprès d’elle. Les bureaux m’ont écrit à ce sujet d’user, s’il le falloit, de mon pouvoir ; mais ne l’exerçant que pour rendre heureux les habitants de cette colonie, j’attends de votre volonté seule un sacrifice de quelques années, d’où dépend l’établissement de votre fille, et le bien-être de toute votre vie. Pourquoi vient-on aux îles ? n’est-ce pas pour y faire fortune ? N’est-il pas bien plus agréable de l’aller retrouver dans sa patrie ? »

En disant ces mots, il posa sur la table un gros sac de piastres que portoit un de ses Noirs. « Voilà, ajouta-t-il, ce qui est destiné aux préparatifs de voyage de mademoiselle votre fille, de la part de votre tante. » Ensuite il finit par reprocher avec bonté à madame de la Tour de ne s’être pas adressée à lui dans ses besoins, en la louant cependant de son noble courage. Paul aussitôt prit la parole, et dit au gouverneur : « Monsieur, ma mère s’est adressée à vous, et vous l’avez mal reçue. — Avez-vous un autre enfant, madame ? dit M. de la Bourdonnais à madame de la Tour. — Non, monsieur, reprit-elle, celui-ci est le fils de mon amie ; mais lui et Virginie nous sont communs, et également chers. — Jeune homme, dit le gouverneur à Paul, quand vous aurez acquis l’expérience du monde, vous connoîtrez le malheur des gens en place ; vous saurez combien il est facile de les prévenir, combien aisément ils donnent au vice intrigant ce qui appartient au mérite qui se cache. »

M. de la Bourdonnais, invité par madame de la Tour, s’assit à table auprès d’elle. Il déjeuna, à la manière des Créoles, avec du café mêlé avec du riz cuit à l’eau. Il fut charmé de l’ordre et de la propreté de la petite case, de l’union de ces deux familles charmantes, et du zèle même de leurs vieux domestiques. « Il n’y a, dit-il, ici que des meubles de bois ; mais on y trouve des visages sereins et des cœurs d’or. »

Paul, charmé de la popularité du gouverneur, lui dit : « Je désire être votre ami, car vous êtes un honnête homme. » M. de la Bourdonnais reçut avec plaisir cette marque de cordialité insulaire. Il embrassa Paul en lui serrant la main, et l’assura qu’il pouvoit compter sur son amitié.

Après déjeuner, il prit madame de la Tour en particulier, et lui dit qu’il se présentoit une occasion prochaine d’envoyer sa fille en France, sur un vaisseau prêt à partir ; qu’il la recommanderoit à une dame de ses parentes qui y étoit passagère ; qu’il falloit bien se garder d’abandonner une fortune immense pour une satisfaction de quelques années. « Votre tante, ajouta-t-il en s’en allant, ne peut pas traîner plus de deux ans : ses amis me l’ont mandé. Songez-y bien. La fortune ne vient pas tous les jours. Consultez-vous. Tous les gens de bon sens seront de mon avis. » Elle lui répondit « que, ne désirant désormais d’autre bonheur dans le monde que celui de sa fille, elle laisseroit son départ pour la France entièrement à sa disposition ».

Madame de la Tour n’étoit pas fâchée de trouver une occasion de séparer pour quelque temps Virginie et Paul, en procurant un jour leur bonheur mutuel. Elle prit donc sa fille à part, et lui dit : « Mon enfant, nos domestiques sont vieux ; Paul est bien jeune, Marguerite vient sur l’âge ; je suis déjà infirme : si j’allois mourir, que deviendriez-vous sans fortune au milieu de ces déserts ? Vous resteriez donc seule, n’ayant personne qui puisse vous être d’un grand secours, et obligée, pour vivre, de travailler sans cesse à la terre comme une mercenaire. Cette idée me pénètre de douleur. » Virginie lui répondit : « Dieu nous a condamnés au travail. Vous m’avez appris à travailler, et à le bénir chaque jour. jusqu’à présent il ne nous a pas abandonnés il ne nous abandonnera point encore. Sa providence veille particulièrement sur les malheureux. Vous me l’avez dit tant de fois, ma mère ! Je ne saurois me résoudre à vous quitter. » Madame de la Tour, émue, reprit : « Je n’ai d’autre projet que de te rendre heureuse et de te marier un jour avec Paul, qui n’est point ton frère. Songe maintenant que sa fortune dépend de toi. »

Une jeune fille qui aime croit que tout le monde l’ignore. Elle met sur ses yeux le voile qu’elle a sur son cœur ; mais quand il est soulevé par une main amie, alors les peines secrètes de son amour s’échappent comme par une barrière ouverte, et les doux épanchements de la confiance succèdent aux réserves et aux mystères dont elle s’environnoit. Virginie, sensible aux nouveaux témoignages de bonté de sa mère, lui raconta quels avoient été ses combats, qui n’avoient eu d’autres témoins que Dieu seul ; qu’elle voyoit le secours de sa providence dans celui d’une mère tendre qui approuvoit son inclination, et qui la dirigeroit par ses conseils ; que maintenant, appuyée de son support, tout l’engageoit à rester auprès d’elle, sans inquiétude pour le présent, et sans crainte pour l’avenir.

Madame de la Tour voyant que sa confidence avoit produit un effet contraire à celui qu’elle en attendoit, lui dit : « Mon enfant, je ne veux point te contraindre ; délibère à ton aise ; mais cache ton amour à Paul. Quand le cœur d’une fille est pris, son amant n’a plus rien à lui demander. »

Vers le soir, comme elle étoit seule avec Virginie, il entra chez elle un grand homme vêtu d’une soutane bleue. C’étoit un ecclésiastique missionnaire de l’île, et confesseur de madame de la Tour et de Virginie. Il était envoyé par le gouverneur. « Mes enfants, dit-il en entrant, Dieu soit loué ! Vous voilà riches. Vous pourrez écouter votre bon cœur, faire du bien aux pauvres. je sais ce que vous a dit M. de la Bourdonnais, et ce que vous lui avez répondu. Bonne maman, votre santé vous oblige de rester ici ; mais vous, jeune demoiselle, vous n’avez point d’excuse. Il faut obéir à la Providence, à nos vieux parents, même injustes. C’est un sacrifice, mais c’est l’ordre de Dieu. Il s’est dévoué pour nous ; il faut, à son exemple, se dévouer pour le bien de sa famille. Votre voyage en France aura une fin heureuse. Ne voulez-vous pas bien y aller, ma chère demoiselle ? »

Virginie, les yeux baissés, lui répondit en tremblant :

« Si c’est l’ordre de Dieu, je ne m’oppose à rien. Que la volonté de Dieu soit faite ! » dit-elle en pleurant.

Le missionnaire sortit, et fut rendre compte au gouverneur du succès de sa commission. Cependant madame de la Tour m’envoya prier par Domingue de passer chez elle pour me consulter sur le départ de Virginie. Je ne fus point du tout d’avis qu’on la laissât partir. Je tiens pour principes certains du bonheur qu’il faut préférer les avantages de la nature à tous ceux de la fortune, et que nous ne devons point aller chercher hors de nous ce que nous pouvons trouver chez nous. J’étends ces maximes à tout, sans exception. Mais que pouvoient mes conseils de modération contre les illusions d’une grande fortune, et mes raisons naturelles contre les préjugés du monde et une autorité sacrée pour madame de la Tour ? Cette dame ne me consulta donc que par bienséance, et elle ne délibéra plus depuis la décision de son confesseur. Marguerite même, qui, malgré les avantages qu’elle espéroit pour son fils de la fortune de Virginie, s’étoit opposée fortement à son départ, ne fit plus d’objections. Pour Paul, qui ignoroit le parti auquel on se déterminoit, étonné des conversations secrètes de madame de la Tour et de sa fille, il s’abandonnoit à une tristesse sombre. « On trame quelque chose contre moi, dit-il, puisqu’on se cache de moi. »

Cependant le bruit s’étant répandu dans l’île que la fortune avoit visité ces rochers, on y vit grimper des marchands de toute espèce. Ils déployèrent, au milieu de ces pauvres cabanes, les plus riches étoffes de l’Inde ; de superbes basins de Goudelour, des mouchoirs de Paliacate et de Mazulipatan, des mousselines de Daca, unies, rayées, brodées, transparentes comme le jour, des baftas de Surate d’un si beau blanc, des chittes de toutes couleurs et des plus rares, à fond sablé et à rameaux verts. Ils déroulèrent de magnifiques étoffes de soie de la Chine, des lampas découpés à jour, des damas d’un blanc satiné, d’autres d’un vert de prairie, d’autres d’un rouge à éblouir ; des taffetas roses, des satins à pleine main, des pékins moelleux comme le drap, des nankins blancs et jaunes, et jusqu’à des pagnes de Madagascar.

Madame de la Tour voulut que sa fille achetât tout ce qui lui feroit plaisir ; elle veilla seulement sur le prix et les qualités des marchandises, de peur que les marchands ne la trompassent. Virginie choisit tout ce qu’elle crut être agréable à sa mère, à Marguerite et à son fils. « Ceci, disoit-elle, étoit bon pour des meubles, cela pour l’usage de Marie et de Domingue. » Enfin le sac de piastres étoit employé qu’elle n’avoit pas encore songé à ses besoins. Il fallut lui faire son partage sur les présents qu’elle avoit distribués à la société.

Paul, pénétré de douleur à la vue de ces dons de la fortune, qui lui présageoient le départ de Virginie, s’en vint quelques jours après chez moi. Il me dit d’un air accablé : « Ma sœur s’en va : elle fait déjà les apprêts de son voyage. Passez chez nous, je vous prie. Employez votre crédit sur l’esprit de sa mère et de la mienne pour la retenir. » Je me rendis aux instances de Paul, quoique bien persuadé que mes représentations seroient sans effet.

Si Virginie m’avoit paru charmante en toile bleue du Bengale, avec un mouchoir rouge autour de sa tête, ce fut encore tout autre chose quand je la vis parée à la manière des dames de ce pays. Elle étoit vêtue de mousseline blanche doublée de taffetas rose. Sa taille légère et élevée se dessinoit parfaitement sous son corset, et ses cheveux blonds, tressés à double tresse, accompagnoient admirablement sa tête virginale. Ses beaux yeux bleus étoient remplis de mélancolie ; et son cœur agité par une passion combattue donnoit à son teint une couleur animée, et à sa voix des sons pleins d’émotion. Le contraste même de sa parure élégante, qu’elle sembloit porter malgré elle, rendoit sa langueur encore plus touchante. Personne ne pouvoit la voir ni l’entendre sans se sentir ému. La tristesse de Paul en augmenta. Marguerite, affligée de la situation de son fils, lui dit en particulier : « Pourquoi, mon fils, te nourrir de fausses espérances, qui rendent les privations encore plus amères ? Il est temps que je te découvre le secret de ta vie et de la mienne. Mademoiselle de la Tour appartient, par sa mère, à une parente riche et de grande condition : pour toi, tu n’es que le fils d’une pauvre paysanne, et, qui pis est, tu es bâtard. »

Ce mot de bâtard étonna beaucoup Paul ; il ne l’avoit jamais ouï prononcer ; il en demanda la signification à sa mère, qui lui répondit : « Tu n’as point eu de père légitime. Lorsque j’étois fille, l’amour me fit commettre une faiblesse dont tu as été le fruit. Ma faute t’a privé de ta famille paternelle, et mon repentir, de ta famille maternelle. Infortuné, tu n’as d’autres parents que moi seule dans le monde ! » et elle se mit à répandre des larmes. Paul, la serrant dans ses bras, lui dit : « Oh, ma mère ! puisque je n’ai d’autres parents que vous dans le monde, je vous en aimerai davantage. Mais quel secret venez-vous de me révéler ! Je vois maintenant la raison qui éloigne de moi mademoiselle de la Tour depuis deux mois, et qui la décide aujourd’hui à partir. Ah ! sans doute, elle me méprise ! »

Cependant, l’heure de souper étant venue, on se mit à table, où chacun des convives, agité de passions différentes, mangea peu et ne parla point. Virginie en sortit la première, et fut s’asseoir au lieu où nous sommes. Paul la suivit bientôt après, et vint se mettre auprès d’elle. L’un et l’autre gardèrent quelque temps un profond silence. Il faisoit une de ces nuits délicieuses, si communes entre les tropiques, et dont le plus habile pinceau ne rendroit pas la beauté. La lune paraissoit au milieu du firmament, entourée d’un rideau de nuages que ses rayons dissipoient par degrés. Sa lumière se répandoit insensiblement sur les montagnes de l’île et sur leurs pitons, qui brilloient d’un vert argenté. Les vents retenoient leurs haleines. On entendoit dans les bois, au fond des vallées, au haut des rochers, de petits cris, de doux murmures d’oiseaux, qui se caressoient dans leurs nids, réjouis par la clarté de la nuit et la tranquillité de l’air. Tous, jusqu’aux insectes, bruissoient sous l’herbe. Les étoiles étinceloient au ciel, et se réfléchissoient au sein de la mer qui répétoit leurs images tremblantes. Virginie parcouroit avec des regards distraits son vaste et sombre horizon, distingué du rivage de l’île par les feux rouges des pêcheurs. Elle aperçut à l’entrée du port une lumière et une ombre : c’étoit le fanal et le corps du vaisseau où elle devoit s’embarquer pour l’Europe, et qui, prêt à mettre à la voile, attendoit à l’ancre la fin du calme. À cette vue elle se troubla, et détourna la tête pour que Paul ne la vît pas pleurer.

Madame de la Tour, Marguerite et moi, nous étions assis à quelques pas de là sous des bananiers ; et dans le silence de la nuit nous entendîmes distinctement leur conversation, que je n’ai pas oubliée.

Paul lui dit : « Mademoiselle, vous partez, dit-on, dans trois jours. Vous ne craignez pas de vous exposer aux dangers de la mer… de la mer dont vous êtes si effrayée ! — Il faut, répondit Virginie, que j’obéisse à mes parents, à mon devoir. — Vous nous quittez, reprit Paul, pour une parente éloignée que vous n’avez jamais vue ! — Hélas ! dit Virginie, je voulois rester ici toute ma vie ; ma mère ne l’a pas voulu. Mon confesseur m’a dit que la volonté de Dieu étoit que je partisse ; que la vie étoit une épreuve… Oh ! c’est une épreuve bien dure ! »

« Quoi, repartit Paul, tant de raisons vous ont décidée, et aucune ne vous a retenue ! Ah ! il en est encore que vous ne me dites pas. La richesse a de grands attraits. Vous trouverez bientôt, dans un nouveau monde, à qui donner le nom de frère, que vous ne me donnez plus. Vous le choisirez, ce frère, parmi des gens dignes de vous par une naissance et une fortune que je ne peux vous offrir. Mais, pour être plus heureuse, où voulez-vous aller ? Dans quelle terre aborderez-vous qui vous soit plus chère que celle où vous êtes née ? Où formerez-vous une société plus aimable que celle qui vous aime ? Comment vivrez-vous sans les caresses de votre mère, auxquelles vous êtes si accoutumée ? Que deviendra-t-elle elle-même, déjà sur l’âge, lorsqu’elle ne vous verra plus à ses côtés, à la table, dans la maison, à la promenade où elle s’appuyoit sur vous ? Que deviendra la mienne, qui vous chérit autant qu’elle ? Que leur dirai-je à l’une et à l’autre quand je les verrai pleurer de votre absence ? Cruelle ! je ne vous parle point de moi : mais que deviendrai-je moi-même quand le matin je ne vous verrai plus avec nous, et que la nuit viendra sans nous réunir ; quand j’apercevrai ces deux palmiers plantés à notre naissance, et si longtemps témoins de notre amitié mutuelle ? Ah ! puisqu’un nouveau sort te touche, que tu cherches d’autres pays que ton pays natal, d’autres biens que ceux de mes travaux, laisse-moi t’accompagner sur le vaisseau où tu pars. Je te rassurerai dans les tempêtes, qui te donnent tant d’effroi sur la terre. Je reposerai ta tête sur mon sein, je réchaufferai ton cœur contre mon cœur ; et en France, où tu vas chercher de la fortune et de la grandeur, je te servirai comme ton esclave. Heureux de ton seul bonheur, dans ces hôtels où je te verrai servie et adorée, je serai encore assez riche et assez noble pour te faire le plus grand des sacrifices, en mourant à tes pieds. »

Les sanglots étouffèrent sa voix, et nous entendîmes aussitôt celle de Virginie qui lui disoit ces mots entrecoupés de soupirs… « C’est pour toi que je pars,… pour toi que j’ai vu chaque jour courbé par le travail pour nourrir deux familles infirmes. Si je me suis prêtée à l’occasion de devenir riche, c’est pour te rendre mille fois le bien que tu nous as fait. Est-il une fortune digne de ton amitié ? Que me dis-tu de ta naissance ? Ah ! s’il m’étoit encore possible de me donner un frère, en choisirois-je un autre que toi ? Ô Paul ! Ô Paul ! tu m’es beaucoup plus cher qu’un frère ! Combien m’en a-t-il coûté pour te repousser loin de moi ! je voulois que tu m’aidasses à me séparer de moi-même jusqu’à ce que le ciel pût bénir notre union. Maintenant je reste, je pars, je vis, je meurs ; fais de moi ce que tu veux. Fille sans vertu ! j’ai pu résister à tes caresses, et je ne peux soutenir ta douleur ! »

À ces mots Paul la saisit dans ses bras, et la tenant étroitement serrée, il s’écria d’une voix terrible : « Je pars avec elle ; rien ne pourra m’en détacher. » Nous courûmes tous à lui. Madame de la Tour lui dit : « Mon fils, si vous nous quittez qu’allons-nous devenir ? »

Il répéta en tremblant ces mots : « Mon fils… mon fils… Vous ma mère, lui dit-il, vous qui séparez le frère d’avec la sœur ! Tous deux nous avons sucé votre lait ; tous deux, élevés sur vos genoux, nous avons appris de vous à nous aimer ; tous deux, nous nous le sommes dit mille fois. Et maintenant vous l’éloignez de moi ! Vous l’envoyez en Europe, dans ce pays barbare qui vous a refusé un asile, et chez des parents cruels qui vous ont vous-même abandonnée. Vous me direz : Vous n’avez plus de droits sur elle, elle n’est pas votre sœur. Elle est tout pour moi, ma richesse, ma famille, ma naissance, tout mon bien. Je n’en connois plus d’autre. Nous n’avons eu qu’un toit, qu’un berceau ; nous n’aurons qu’un tombeau. Si elle part, il faut que je la suive. Le gouverneur m’en empêchera ? M’empêchera-t-il de me jeter à la mer ? je la suivrai à la nage. La mer ne sauroit m’être plus funeste que la terre. Ne pouvant vivre ici près d’elle, au moins je mourrai sous ses yeux, loin de vous. Mère barbare ! femme sans pitié ! puisse cet océan où vous l’exposez ne jamais vous la rendre ! puissent ses flots vous rapporter mon corps, et, le roulant avec le sien parmi les cailloux de ces rivages, vous donner, par la perte de vos deux enfants, un sujet éternel de douleur ! ».

À ces mots je le saisis dans mes bras ; car le désespoir lui ôtait la raison. Ses yeux étinceloient ; la sueur couloit à grosses gouttes sur son visage en feu ; ses genoux trembloient, et je sentois dans sa poitrine brûlante son cœur battre à coups redoublés.

Virginie effrayée lui dit : « Ô mon ami ! j’atteste les plaisirs de notre premier âge, tes maux, les miens, et tout ce qui doit lier à jamais deux infortunés, si je reste, de ne vivre que pour toi ; si je pars, de revenir un jour pour être à toi. Je vous prends à témoin, vous tous qui avez élevé mon enfance, qui disposez de ma vie et qui voyez mes larmes. Je le jure par ce ciel qui m’entend, par cette mer que je dois traverser, par l’air que je respire, et que je n’ai jamais souillé du mensonge. »

Comme le soleil fond et précipite un rocher de glace du sommet des Apennins, ainsi tomba la colère impétueuse de ce jeune homme à la voix de l’objet aimé. Sa tête altière étoit baissée, et un torrent de pleurs couloit de ses yeux. Sa mère, mêlant ses larmes aux siennes, le tenoit embrassé sans pouvoir parler. Madame de la Tour, hors d’elle, me dit : « Je n’y puis tenir ; mon âme est déchirée. Ce malheureux voyage n’aura pas lieu. Mon voisin, tâchez d’emmener mon fils. Il y a huit jours que personne ici n’a dormi. »

Je dis à Paul : « Mon ami, votre sœur restera. Demain nous en parlerons au gouverneur : laissez reposer votre famille, et venez passer cette nuit chez moi. Il est tard, il est minuit ; la Croix du Sud est droite sur l’horizon. »

Il se laissa emmener sans rien dire, et après une nuit fort agitée, il se leva au point du jour, et s’en retourna à son habitation.

Mais qu’est-il besoin de vous continuer plus longtemps le récit de cette histoire ? Il n’y a jamais qu’un côté agréable à connoître dans la vie humaine. Semblable au globe sur lequel nous tournons, notre révolution rapide n’est que d’un jour, et une partie de ce jour ne peut recevoir la lumière que l’autre ne soit livrée aux ténèbres.

« Mon père, lui dis-je, je vous en conjure, achevez de me raconter ce que vous avez commencé d’une manière si touchante. Les images du bonheur nous plaisent, mais celles du malheur nous instruisent. Que devint, je vous prie, l’infortuné Paul ? » Le premier objet que vit Paul, en retournant à l’habitation, fut la négresse Marie, qui, montée sur un rocher, regardoit vers la pleine mer. Il lui cria du plus loin qu’il l’aperçut : « Où est Virginie ? » Marie tourna la tête vers son jeune maître, et se mit à pleurer. Paul, hors de lui, revint sur ses pas, et courut au port. Il y apprit que Virginie s’étoit embarquée au point du jour, que son vaisseau avoit mis à la voile aussitôt, et qu’on ne le voyoit plus. Il revint à l’habitation, qu’il traversa sans parler à personne.

Quoique cette enceinte de rochers paraisse derrière nous presque perpendiculaire, ces plateaux verts qui en divisent la hauteur sont autant d’étages par lesquels on parvient, au moyen de quelques sentiers difficiles, jusqu’au pied de ce cône de rochers incliné et inaccessible, qu’on appelle le Pouce. À la base de ce rocher est une esplanade couverte de grands arbres, mais si élevée et si escarpée qu’elle est comme une grande forêt dans l’air, environnée de précipices effroyables. Les nuages que le sommet du Pouce attire sans cesse autour de lui y entretiennent plusieurs ruisseaux, qui tombent à une si grande profondeur au fond de la vallée, située au revers de cette montagne, que de cette hauteur on n’entend point le bruit de leur chute. De ce lieu on voit une grande partie de l’île avec ses mornes surmontés de leurs pitons, entre autres Piterboth et les Trois-Mamelles avec leurs vallons remplis de forêts ; puis la pleine mer, et l’île Bourbon, qui est à quarante lieues de là vers l’Occident. Ce fut de cette élévation

que Paul aperçut le vaisseau qui emmenoit Virginie. Il le vit à plus de dix lieues au large comme un point noir au milieu de l’océan. Il resta une partie du jour tout occupé à le considérer : il étoit déjà disparu qu’il croyoit le voir encore ; et quand il fut perdu dans la vapeur de l’horizon, il s’assit dans ce lieu sauvage, toujours battu des vents, qui y agitent sans cesse les sommets des palmistes et des tatamaques. Leur murmure sourd et mugissant ressemble au bruit lointain des orgues, et inspire une profonde mélancolie. Ce fut là que je trouvai Paul, la tête appuyée contre le rocher, et les yeux fixés vers la terre. Je marchois après lui depuis le lever du soleil : j’eus beaucoup de peine à le déterminer à descendre, et à revoir sa famille. Je le ramenai cependant à son habitation ; et son premier mouvement, en revoyant madame de la Tour, fut de se plaindre amèrement qu’elle l’avoit trompé. Madame de la Tour nous dit que le vent s’étant levé vers les trois heures du matin, le vaisseau étant au moment d’appareiller, le gouverneur, suivi d’une partie de son état-major et du missionnaire, étoit venu chercher Virginie en palanquin ; et que, malgré ses propres raisons, ses larmes, et celles de Marguerite, tout le monde criant que c’étoit pour leur bien à tous, ils avoient emmené sa fille à demi mourante. « Au moins, répondit Paul, si je lui avois fait mes adieux, je serois tranquille à présent. Je lui aurois dit : Virginie, si pendant le temps que nous avons vécu ensemble, il m’est échappé quelque parole qui vous ait offensée, avant de me quitter pour jamais, dites-moi que vous me la pardonnez. Je lui aurois dit : Puisque je ne suis plus destiné à vous revoir, adieu, ma chère Virginie ! adieu ! Vivez loin de moi contente et heureuse ! » Et comme il vit que sa mère et madame de la Tour pleuroient : « Cherchez maintenant, leur dit-il, quelque autre que moi qui essuie vos larmes ! » puis il s’éloigna d’elles en gémissant, et se mit à errer çà et là dans l’habitation. Il en parcouroit tous les endroits qui avoient été les plus chers à Virginie. Il disoit à ses chèvres et à leurs petits chevreaux, qui le suivoient en bêlant : « Que me demandez-vous ? Vous ne reverrez plus avec moi celle qui vous donnoit à manger dans sa main. » Il fut au Repos de Virginie, et à la vue des oiseaux qui voltigeoient autour, il s’écria : « Pauvres oiseaux ! Vous n’irez plus au-devant de celle qui étoit votre bonne nourrice. » En voyant Fidèle qui flairoit çà et là et marchoit devant lui en quêtant, il soupira, et lui dit : « Oh ! tu ne la retrouveras plus jamais. » Enfin il fut s’asseoir sur le rocher où il lui avoit parlé la veille, et à l’aspect de la mer où il avoit vu disparaître le vaisseau qui l’avoit emmenée, il pleura abondamment.

Cependant nous le suivions pas à pas, craignant quelque suite funeste de l’agitation de son esprit. Sa mère et madame de la Tour le prioient par les termes les plus tendres de ne pas augmenter leur douleur par son désespoir. Enfin celle-ci parvint à le calmer en lui prodiguant les noms les plus propres à réveiller ses espérances. Elle l’appeloit son fils, son cher fils, son gendre, celui à qui elle destinoit sa fille. Elle l’engagea à rentrer dans la maison, et à y prendre quelque peu de nourriture. Il se mit à table avec nous auprès de la place où se mettoit la compagne de son enfance ; et, comme si elle l’eût encore occupée, il lui adressoit la parole et lui présentoit les mets qu’il savoit lui être les plus agréables ; mais dès qu’il s’apercevoit de son erreur il se mettoit à pleurer. Les jours suivants il recueillit tout ce qui avoit été à son usage particulier, les derniers bouquets qu’elle avoit portés, une tasse de coco où elle avoit coutume de boire ; et comme si ces restes de son amie eussent été les choses du monde les plus précieuses, il les baisoit et les mettoit dans son sein. L’ambre ne répand pas un parfum aussi doux que les objets touchés par l’objet que l’on aime. Enfin, voyant que ses regrets augmentoient ceux de sa mère et de madame de la Tour, et que les besoins de la famille demandoient un travail continuel, il se mit, avec l’aide de Domingue, à réparer le jardin.

Bientôt ce jeune homme, indifférent comme un Créole pour tout ce qui se passe dans le monde, me pria de lui apprendre à lire et à écrire, afin qu’il pût entretenir une correspondance avec Virginie. Il voulut ensuite s’instruire dans la géographie pour se faire une idée du pays où elle débarqueroit ; et dans l’histoire, pour connoître les mœurs de la société où elle alloit vivre. Ainsi il s’étoit perfectionné dans l’agriculture, et dans l’art de disposer avec agrément le terrain le plus irrégulier, par le sentiment de l’amour. Sans doute c’est aux jouissances que se propose cette passion ardente et inquiète que les hommes doivent la plupart des sciences et des arts, et c’est de ses privations qu’est née la philosophie, qui apprend à se consoler de tout. Ainsi la nature ayant fait l’amour le lien de tous les êtres, l’a rendu le premier mobile de nos sociétés, et l’instigateur de nos lumières et de nos plaisirs.

Paul ne trouva pas beaucoup de goût dans l’étude de la géographie, qui, au lieu de nous décrire la nature de chaque pays, ne nous en présente que les divisions politiques. L’histoire, et surtout l’histoire moderne, ne l’intéressa guère davantage. Il n’y voyoit que des malheurs généraux et périodiques, dont il n’apercevoit pas les causes ; des guerres sans sujet et sans objet ; des intrigues obscures ; des nations sans caractère et des princes sans humanité. Il préféroit à cette lecture celle des romans, qui, s’occupant davantage des sentiments et des intérêts des hommes, lui offroient quelquefois des situations pareilles à la sienne. Aussi aucun livre ne lui fit autant de plaisir que le Télémaque, par ses tableaux de la vie champêtre et des passions naturelles au cœur humain. Il en lisoit à sa mère et à madame de la Tour les endroits qui l’affectoient davantage : alors ému par de touchants ressouvenirs, sa voix s’étouffoit, et les larmes couloient de ses yeux. Il lui sembloit trouver dans Virginie la dignité et la sagesse d’Antiope, avec les malheurs et la tendresse d’Eucharis. D’un autre côté il fut tout bouleversé par la lecture de nos romans à la mode, pleins de mœurs et de maximes licencieuses ; et quand il sut que ces romans renfermoient une peinture véritable des sociétés de l’Europe, il craignit, non sans quelque apparence de raison, que Virginie ne vint à s’y corrompre et à l’oublier.

En effet plus d’un an et demi s’étoit écoulé sans que madame de la Tour eût des nouvelles de sa tante et de sa fille : seulement elle avoit appris, par une voie étrangère, que celle-ci étoit arrivée heureusement en France. Enfin elle reçut, par un vaisseau qui alloit aux Indes, un paquet, et une lettre écrite de la propre main de Virginie. Malgré la circonspection de son aimable et indulgente fille, elle jugea qu’elle étoit fort malheureuse. Cette lettre peignoit si bien sa situation et son caractère, que je l’ai retenue presque mot pour mot.

« Très chère et bien-aimée maman,

« Je vous ai déjà écrit plusieurs lettres de mon écriture ; et comme je n’en ai pas eu de réponse, j’ai lieu de craindre qu’elles ne vous soient point parvenues. J’espère mieux de celle-ci, par les précautions que j’ai prises pour vous donner de mes nouvelles, et pour recevoir des vôtres.

« J’ai versé bien des larmes depuis notre séparation, moi qui n’avois presque jamais pleuré que sur les maux d’autrui ! Ma grand-tante fut bien surprise à mon arrivée, lorsque m’ayant questionnée sur mes talents, je lui dis que je ne savois ni lire ni écrire. Elle me demanda qu’est-ce que j’avois donc appris depuis que j’étois au monde ; et quand je lui eus répondu que c’étoit à avoir soin d’un ménage et à faire votre volonté, elle me dit que j’avois reçu l’éducation d’une servante. Elle me mit, dès le lendemain, en pension dans une grande abbaye auprès de Paris, où j’ai des maîtres de toute espèce ; ils m’enseignent, entre autres choses, l’histoire, la géographie, la grammaire, la mathématique, et à monter à cheval ; mais j’ai de si faibles dispositions pour toutes ces sciences, que je ne profiterai pas beaucoup avec ces messieurs. Je sens que je suis une pauvre créature qui ai peu d’esprit, comme ils le font entendre. Cependant les bontés de ma tante ne se refroidissent point. Elle me donne des robes nouvelles à chaque saison. Elle a mis près de moi deux femmes de chambre, qui sont aussi bien parées que de grandes dames. Elle m’a fait prendre le titre de comtesse ; mais elle m’a fait quitter mon nom de La Tour, qui m’étoit aussi cher qu’à vous-même, par tout ce que vous m’avez raconté des peines que mon père avoit souffertes pour vous épouser. Elle a remplacé votre nom de femme par celui de votre famille, qui m’est encore cher cependant, parce qu’il a été votre nom de fille. Me voyant dans une situation aussi brillante, je l’ai suppliée de vous envoyer quelques secours. Comment vous rendre sa réponse ? Mais vous m’avez recommandé de vous dire toujours la vérité. Elle m’a donc répondu que peu ne vous serviroit à rien, et que, dans la vie simple que vous menez, beaucoup vous embarrasseroit. J’ai cherché d’abord à vous donner de mes nouvelles par une main étrangère, au défaut de la mienne. Mais n’ayant à mon arrivée ici personne en qui je pusse prendre confiance, je me suis appliquée nuit et jour à apprendre à lire et à écrire : Dieu m’a fait la grâce d’en venir à bout en peu de temps. J’ai chargé de l’envoi de mes premières lettres les dames qui sont autour de moi ; j’ai lieu de croire qu’elles les ont remises à ma grand-tante. Cette fois, j’ai eu recours à une pensionnaire de mes amies : c’est sous son adresse ci-jointe que je vous prie de me faire passer vos réponses. Ma grand-tante m’a interdit toute correspondance au dehors, qui pourroit, selon elle, mettre obstacle aux grandes vues qu’elle a sur moi. Il n’y a qu’elle qui puisse me voir à la grille, ainsi qu’un vieux seigneur de ses amis, qui a, dit-elle, beaucoup de goût pour ma personne. Pour dire la vérité, je n’en ai point du tout pour lui, quand même j’en pourrois prendre pour quelqu’un.

Je vis au milieu de l’éclat de la fortune, et je ne peux disposer d’un sou. On dit que si j’avois de l’argent cela tireroit à conséquence. Mes robes mêmes appartiennent à mes femmes de chambre, qui se les disputent avant que je les aie quittées. Au sein des richesses je suis bien plus pauvre que je ne l’étois auprès de vous ; car je n’ai rien à donner. Lorsque j’ai vu que les grands talents que l’on m’enseignoit ne me procuroient pas la facilité de faire le plus petit bien, j’ai eu recours à mon aiguille, dont heureusement vous m’avez appris à faire usage. Je vous envoie donc plusieurs paires de bas de ma façon, pour vous et maman Marguerite, un bonnet pour Domingue, et un de mes mouchoirs rouges pour Marie. Je joins à ce paquet des pépins et des noyaux des fruits de mes collations, avec des graines de toutes sortes d’arbres que j’ai recueillies, à mes heures de récréation, dans le parc de l’abbaye. J’y ai ajouté aussi des semences de violettes, de marguerites, de bassinets, de coquelicots, de bluets, de scabieuses, que j’ai ramassées dans les champs. Il y a dans les prairies de ce pays de plus belles fleurs que dans les nôtres ; mais personne ne s’en soucie. Je suis sûre que vous et maman Marguerite serez plus contentes de ce sac de graines que du sac de piastres qui a été la cause de notre séparation et de mes larmes. Ce sera une grande joie pour moi si vous avez un jour la satisfaction de voir des pommiers croître auprès de nos bananiers, et des hêtres mêler leurs feuillages à celui de nos cocotiers. Vous vous croirez dans la Normandie, que vous aimez tant.

Vous m’avez enjoint de vous mander mes joies et mes peines. Je n’ai plus de joies loin de vous : pour mes peines, je les adoucis en pensant que je suis dans un poste où vous m’avez mise par la volonté de Dieu. Mais le plus grand chagrin que j’y éprouve est que personne ne me parle ici de vous, et que je n’en puis parler à personne. Mes femmes de chambre, ou plutôt celles de ma grand-tante, car elles sont plus à elle qu’à moi, me disent, lorsque je cherche à amener la conversation sur des objets qui me sont si chers : Mademoiselle, souvenez-vous que vous êtes Française, et que vous devez oublier le pays des sauvages. Ah ! je m’oublierois plutôt moi-même que d’oublier le lieu où je suis née, et où vous vivez ! C’est ce pays-ci qui est pour moi un pays de sauvages ; car j’y vis seule, n’ayant personne à qui je puisse faire part de l’amour que vous portera jusqu’au tombeau,

« Très chère et bien-aimée maman, Votre obéissante et tendre fille,

Virginie de la Tour. »

« Je recommande à vos bontés Marie et Domingue, qui ont pris tant de soin de mon enfance ; caressez pour moi Fidèle, qui m’a retrouvée dans les bois. »

Paul fut bien étonné de ce que Virginie ne parloit pas du tout de lui, elle qui n’avoit pas oublié, dans ses ressouvenirs, le chien de la maison : mais il ne savait pas que, quelque longue que soit la lettre d’une femme, elle n’y met jamais sa pensée la plus chère qu’à la fin.

Dans un post-scriptum Virginie recommandoit particulièrement à Paul deux espèces de graines : celles de violettes et de scabieuses. Elle lui donnoit quelques instructions sur les caractères de ces plantes, et sur les lieux les plus propres à les semer. « La violette, lui mandoit-elle, produit une petite fleur d’un violet foncé, qui aime à se cacher sous les buissons ; mais son charmant parfum l’y fait bientôt découvrir. » Elle lui enjoignoit de la semer sur le bord de la fontaine, au pied de son cocotier. « La scabieuse, ajoutoit-elle, donne une jolie fleur d’un bleu mourant, et à fond noir piqueté de blanc. On la croiroit en deuil. On l’appelle aussi, pour cette raison, fleur de veuve. Elle se plaît dans les lieux âpres et battus des vents. » Elle le prioit de la semer sur le rocher où elle lui avoit parlé la nuit, la dernière fois, et de donner à ce rocher, pour l’amour d’elle, le nom du Rocher des adieux.

Elle avoit renfermé ces semences dans une petite bourse dont le tissu étoit fort simple, mais qui parut sans prix à Paul lorsqu’il y aperçut un P et un V entrelacés et formés de cheveux, qu’il reconnut à leur beauté pour être ceux de Virginie.

La lettre de cette sensible et vertueuse demoiselle fit verser des larmes à toute la famille. Sa mère lui répondit, au nom de la société, de rester ou de revenir à son gré, l’assurant qu’ils avoient tous perdu la meilleure partie de leur bonheur depuis son départ, et que pour elle en particulier elle en étoit inconsolable.

Paul lui écrivit une lettre fort longue où il l’assuroit qu’il alloit rendre le jardin digne d’elle, et y mêler les plantes de l’Europe à celles de l’Afrique, ainsi qu’elle avoit entrelacé leurs noms dans son ouvrage. Il lui envoyoit des fruits des cocotiers de sa fontaine, parvenus à une maturité parfaite. Il n’y joignoit, ajoutoit-il, aucune autre semence de l’île, afin que le désir d’en revoir les productions la déterminât à y revenir promptement. Il la supplioit de se rendre au plus tôt aux vœux ardents de leur famille, et aux siens particuliers, puisqu’il ne pouvoit désormais goûter aucune joie loin d’elle.

Paul sema avec le plus grand soin les graines européennes, et surtout celles de violettes et de scabieuses, dont les fleurs sembloient avoir quelque analogie avec le caractère et la situation de Virginie, qui les lui avoit si particulièrement recommandées ; mais, soit qu’elles eussent été éventées dans le trajet, soit plutôt que le climat de cette partie de l’Afrique ne leur soit pas favorable, il n’en germa qu’un petit nombre, qui ne put venir à sa perfection.

Cependant l’envie, qui va même au-devant du bonheur des hommes, surtout dans les colonies françaises, répandit dans l’île des bruits qui donnoient beaucoup d’inquiétude à Paul. Les gens du vaisseau qui avoit apporté la lettre de Virginie assuroient qu’elle étoit sur le point de se marier : ils nommoient le seigneur de la cour qui devoit l’épouser ; quelques-uns même disoient que la chose étoit faite et qu’ils en avoient été témoins. D’abord Paul méprisa des nouvelles apportées par un vaisseau de commerce, qui en répand souvent de fausses sur les lieux de son passage. Mais comme plusieurs habitants de l’île, par une pitié perfide, s’empressoient de le plaindre de cet événement, il commença à y ajouter quelque croyance. D’ailleurs dans quelques-uns des romans qu’il avoit lu, il voyoit la trahison traitée de plaisanterie ; et comme il savoit que ces livres renfermoient des peintures assez fidèles des mœurs de l’Europe, il craignit que la fille de madame de la Tour ne vînt à s’y corrompre, et à oublier ses anciens engagements. Ses lumières le rendoient déjà malheureux. Ce qui acheva d’augmenter ses craintes, c’est que plusieurs vaisseaux d’Europe arrivèrent ici depuis, dans l’espace de six mois, sans qu’aucun d’eux apportât des nouvelles de Virginie.

Cet infortuné jeune homme, livré à toutes les agitations de son cœur, venoit me voir souvent, pour confirmer ou pour bannir ses inquiétudes par mon expérience du monde.

Je demeure, comme je vous l’ai dit, à une lieue et demie d’ici, sur les bords d’une petite rivière qui coule le long de la Montagne Longue. C’est là que je passe ma vie seul, sans femme, sans enfants, et sans esclaves.

Après le rare bonheur de trouver une compagne qui nous soit bien assortie, l’état le moins malheureux de la vie est sans doute de vivre seul. Tout homme qui a eu beaucoup à se plaindre des hommes cherche la solitude. Il est même très remarquable que tous les peuples malheureux par leurs opinions, leurs mœurs ou leurs gouvernements, ont produit des classes nombreuses de citoyens entièrement dévoués à la solitude et au célibat. Tels ont été les Égyptiens dans leur décadence, les Grecs du Bas Empire ; et tels sont de nos jours les Indiens, les Chinois, les Grecs modernes, les Italiens, et la plupart des peuples orientaux et méridionaux de l’Europe. La solitude ramène en partie l’homme au bonheur naturel, en éloignant de lui le malheur social. Au milieu de nos sociétés, divisées par tant de préjugés, l’âme est dans une agitation continuelle ; elle roule sans cesse en elle-même mille opinions turbulentes et contradictoires dont les membres d’une société ambitieuse et misérable cherchent à se subjuguer les uns les autres. Mais dans la solitude elle dépose ces illusions étrangères qui la troublent ; elle reprend le sentiment simple d’elle-même, de la nature et de son auteur. Ainsi l’eau bourbeuse d’un torrent qui ravage les campagnes, venant à se répandre dans quelque petit bassin écarté de son cours, dépose ses vases au fond de son lit, reprend sa première limpidité, et, redevenue transparente, réfléchit, avec ses propres rivages, la verdure de la terre et la lumière des cieux. La solitude rétablit aussi bien les harmonies du corps que celles de l’âme. C’est dans la classe des solitaires que se trouvent les hommes qui poussent le plus loin la carrière de la vie ; tels sont les brames de l’Inde. Enfin je la crois si nécessaire au bonheur dans le monde même, qu’il me paroît impossible d’y goûter un plaisir durable, de quelque sentiment que ce soit, ou de régler sa conduite sur quelque principe stable, si l’on ne se fait une solitude intérieure, d’où notre opinion sorte bien rarement, et où celle d’autrui n’entre jamais. Je ne veux pas dire toutefois que l’homme doive vivre absolument seul : il est lié avec tout le genre humain par ses besoins ; il doit donc ses travaux aux hommes ; il se doit aussi au reste de la nature. Mais, comme Dieu a donné à chacun de nous des organes parfaitement assortis aux éléments du globe où nous vivons, des pieds pour le sol, des poumons pour l’air, des yeux pour la lumière, sans que nous puissions intervertir l’usage de ces sens, il s’est réservé pour lui seul, qui est l’auteur de la vie, le cœur, qui en est le principal organe.

Je passe donc mes jours loin des hommes, que j’ai voulu servir, et qui m’ont persécuté. Après avoir parcouru une grande partie de l’Europe, et quelques cantons de l’Amérique et de l’Afrique, je me suis fixé dans cette île peu habitée, séduit par sa douce température et par ses solitudes. Une cabane que j’ai bâtie dans la forêt au pied d’un arbre, un petit champ défriché de mes mains, une rivière qui coule devant ma porte, suffisent à mes besoins et à mes plaisirs. Je joins à ces jouissances celle de quelques bons livres qui m’apprennent à devenir meilleur. Ils font encore servir à mon bonheur le monde même que j’ai quitté ; ils me présentent des tableaux des passions qui en rendent les habitants si misérables, et par la comparaison que je fais de leur sort au mien, ils me font jouir d’un bonheur négatif. Comme un homme sauvé du naufrage sur un rocher, je contemple de ma solitude les orages qui frémissent dans le reste du monde ; mon repos même redouble par le bruit lointain de la tempête. Depuis que les hommes ne sont plus sur mon chemin, et que je ne suis plus sur le leur, je ne les hais plus ; je les plains. Si je rencontre quelque infortuné, je tâche de venir à son secours par mes conseils, comme un passant sur le bord d’un torrent tend la main à un malheureux qui s’y noie. Mais je n’ai guère trouvé que l’innocence attentive à ma voix. La nature appelle en vain à elle le reste des hommes ; chacun d’eux se fait d’elle une image qu’il revêt de ses propres passions. Il poursuit toute sa vie ce vain fantôme qui l’égare, et il se plaint ensuite au ciel de l’erreur qu’il s’est formée lui-même. Parmi un grand nombre d’infortunés que j’ai quelquefois essayé de ramener à la nature, je n’en ai pas trouvé un seul qui ne fût enivré de ses propres misères. Ils m’écoutoient d’abord avec attention dans l’espérance que je les aiderois à acquérir de la gloire ou de la fortune ; mais voyant que je ne voulois leur apprendre qu’à s’en passer, ils me trouvoient moi-même misérable de ne pas courir après leur malheureux bonheur : ils blâmoient ma vie solitaire ; ils prétendoient qu’eux seuls étoient utiles aux hommes, et ils s’efforçoient de m’entraîner dans leur tourbillon. Mais si je me communique à tout le monde, je ne me livre à personne. Souvent il me suffit de moi pour me servir de leçon à moi-même. Je repasse dans le calme présent les agitations passées de ma propre vie, auxquelles j’ai donné tant de prix ; les protections, la fortune, la réputation, les voluptés, et les opinions qui se combattent par toute la terre. Je compare tant d’hommes que j’ai vus se disputer avec fureur ces chimères, et qui ne sont plus, aux flots de ma rivière, qui se brisent en écumant contre les rochers de son lit, et disparaissent pour ne revenir jamais. Pour moi, je me laisse entraîner en paix au fleuve du temps, vers l’océan de l’avenir qui n’a plus de rivages ; et par le spectacle des harmonies actuelles de la nature, je m’élève vers son auteur, et j’espère dans un autre monde de plus heureux destins.

Quoiqu’on n’aperçoive pas de mon ermitage, situé au milieu d’une forêt, cette multitude d’objets que nous présente l’élévation du lieu où nous sommes, il s’y trouve des dispositions intéressantes, surtout pour un homme qui, comme moi, aime mieux rentrer en lui-même que s’étendre au-dehors. La rivière qui coule devant ma porte passe en ligne droite à travers les bois, en sorte qu’elle me présente un long canal ombragé d’arbres de toute sorte de feuillages : il y a des tatamaques, des bois d’ébène, et de ceux qu’on appelle ici bois de pomme, bois d’olive, et bois de cannelle ; des bosquets de palmistes élèvent çà et là leurs colonnes nues, et longues de plus de cent pieds, surmontées à leurs sommets d’un bouquet de palmes, et paraissent au-dessus des autres arbres comme une forêt plantée sur une autre forêt. Il s’y joint des lianes de divers feuillages, qui, s’enlaçant d’un arbre à l’autre, forment ici des arcades de fleurs, là de longues courtines de verdure. Des odeurs aromatiques sortent de la plupart de ces arbres, et leurs parfums ont tant d’influence sur les vêtements mêmes, qu’on sent ici un homme qui a traversé une forêt quelques heures après qu’il en est sorti. Dans la saison où ils donnent leurs fleurs vous les diriez à demi couverts de neige. À la fin de l’été plusieurs espèces d’oiseaux étrangers viennent, par un instinct incompréhensible, de régions inconnues, au-delà des vastes mers, récolter les graines des végétaux de cette île, et opposent l’éclat de leurs couleurs à la verdure des arbres rembrunie par le soleil. Telles sont, entre autres, diverses espèces de perruches, et les pigeons bleus, appelés ici pigeons hollandois. Les singes, habitants domiciliés de ces forêts, se jouent dans leurs sombres rameaux, dont ils se détachent par leur poil gris et verdâtre, et leur face toute noire ; quelques-uns s’y suspendent par la queue et se balancent en l’air ; d’autres sautent de branche en branche, portant leurs petits dans leurs bras. Jamais le fusil meurtrier n’y a effrayé ces paisibles enfants de la nature. On n’y entend que des cris de joie, des gazouillements et des ramages inconnus de quelques oiseaux des terres australes, que répètent au loin les échos de ces forêts. La rivière qui coule en bouillonnant sur un lit de roche, à travers les arbres, réfléchit çà et là dans ses eaux limpides leurs masses vénérables de verdure et d’ombre, ainsi que les jeux de leurs heureux habitants : à mille pas de là elle se précipite de différents étages de rocher, et forme à sa chute une nappe d’eau unie comme le cristal, qui se brise en tombant en bouillons d’écume. Mille bruits confus sortent de ces eaux tumultueuses, et dispersés par les vents dans la forêt, tantôt ils fuient au loin, tantôt ils se rapprochent tous à la fois, et assourdissent, comme les sons des cloches d’une cathédrale. L’air, sans cesse renouvelé par le mouvement des eaux, entretient sur les bords de cette rivière, malgré les ardeurs de l’été, une verdure et une fraîcheur, qu’on trouve rarement dans cette île sur le haut même des montagnes.

À quelque distance de là est un rocher assez éloigné de la cascade pour qu’on n’y soit pas étourdi du bruit de ses eaux, et qui en est assez voisin pour y jouir de leur vue, de leur fraîcheur et de leur murmure. Nous allions quelquefois dans les grandes chaleurs dîner à l’ombre de ce rocher, madame de la Tour, Marguerite, Virginie, Paul et moi. Comme Virginie dirigeoit toujours au bien d’autrui ses actions même les plus communes, elle ne mangeoit pas un fruit à la campagne qu’elle n’en mît en terre les noyaux ou les pépins : « Il en viendra, disoit-elle, des arbres qui donneront leurs fruits à quelque voyageur, ou au moins à un oiseau. » Un jour donc qu’elle avoit mangé une papaye au pied de ce rocher, elle y planta les semences de ce fruit. Bientôt après il y crût plusieurs papayers, parmi lesquels il y en avoit un femelle, c’est-à-dire qui porte des fruits. Cet arbre n’étoit pas si haut que le genou de Virginie à son départ ; mais comme il croît vite, deux ans après il avoit vingt pieds de hauteur, et son tronc étoit entouré dans sa partie supérieure de plusieurs rangs de fruits mûrs. Paul, s’étant rendu par hasard dans ce lieu, fut rempli de joie en voyant ce grand arbre sorti d’une petite graine qu’il avoit vu planter par son amie ; et en même temps il fut saisi d’une tristesse profonde par ce témoignage de sa longue absence. Les objets que nous voyons habituellement ne nous font pas apercevoir de la rapidité de notre vie ; ils vieillissent avec nous d’une vieillesse insensible : mais ce sont ceux que nous revoyons tout à coup après les avoir perdus quelques années de vue, qui nous avertissent de la vitesse avec laquelle s’écoule le fleuve de nos jours. Paul fut aussi surpris et aussi troublé à la vue de ce grand papayer chargé de fruits, qu’un voyageur l’est, après une longue absence de son pays, de n’y plus retrouver ses contemporains, et d’y voir leurs enfants, qu’il avoit laissés à la mamelle, devenus eux-mêmes pères de famille. Tantôt il vouloit l’abattre, parce qu’il lui rendoit trop sensible la longueur du temps qui s’étoit écoulé depuis le départ de Virginie ; tantôt, le considérant comme un monument de sa bienfaisance, il baisoit son tronc, et lui adressoit des paroles pleines d’amour et de regrets. Ô arbre dont la postérité existe encore dans nos bois, je vous ai vu moi-même avec plus d’intérêt et de vénération que les arcs de triomphe des Romains ! Puisse la nature, qui détruit chaque jour les monuments de l’ambition des rois, multiplier dans nos forêts ceux de la bienfaisance d’une jeune et pauvre fille !

C’étoit donc au pied de ce papayer que j’étois sûr de rencontrer Paul quand il venoit dans mon quartier. Un jour je l’y trouvai accablé de mélancolie, et j’eus avec lui une conversation que je vais vous rapporter, si je ne vous suis point trop ennuyeux par mes longues digressions, pardonnables à mon âge et à mes dernières amitiés. Je vous la raconterai en forme de dialogue, afin que vous jugiez du bon sens naturel de ce jeune homme ; et il vous sera aisé de faire la différence des interlocuteurs par le sens de ses questions et de mes réponses.

Il me dit : « Je suis bien chagrin. Mademoiselle de la Tour est partie depuis deux ans et deux mois ; et depuis huit mois et demi elle ne nous a pas donné de ses nouvelles. Elle est riche ; je suis pauvre : elle m’a oublié. J’ai envie de m’embarquer : j’irai en France, j’y servirai le roi, j’y ferai fortune ; et la grand-tante de mademoiselle de la Tour nie donnera sa petite nièce en mariage, quand je serai devenu un grand seigneur.

Le Vieillard : « Oh mon ami ! ne m’avez-vous pas dit que vous n’aviez pas de naissance ?

Paul : « Ma mère me l’a dit ; car pour moi je ne sais ce que c’est que la naissance. Je ne me suis jamais aperçu que j’en eusse moins qu’un autre, ni que les autres en eussent plus que moi.

Le Vieillard : « Le défaut de naissance vous ferme en France le chemin aux grands emplois. Il y a plus : vous ne pouvez même être admis dans aucun corps distingué.

Paul : « Vous m’avez dit plusieurs fois qu’une des causes de la grandeur de la France étoit que le moindre sujet pouvoit y parvenir à tout, et vous m’avez cité beaucoup d’hommes célèbres qui, sortis de petits états, avoient fait honneur à leur patrie. Vous vouliez donc tromper mon courage ?

Le Vieillard : « Mon fils, jamais je ne l’abattrai. Je vous ai dit la vérité sur les temps passés ; mais les choses sont bien changées à présent : tout est devenu vénal en France ; tout y est aujourd’hui le patrimoine d’un petit nombre de familles, ou le partage des corps. Le roi est un soleil que les grands et les corps environnent comme des nuages ; il est presque impossible qu’un de ses rayons tombe sur vous. Autrefois, dans une administration moins compliquée, on a vu ces phénomènes. Alors les talents et le mérite se sont développés de toutes parts, comme des terres nouvelles qui, venant à être défrichées, produisent avec tout leur suc. Mais les grands rois qui savent connoître les hommes et les choisir, sont rares. Le vulgaire des rois ne se laisse aller qu’aux impulsions des grands et des corps qui les environnent.

Paul : « Mais je trouverai peut-être un de ces grands qui me protégera.

Le Vieillard : « Pour être protégé des grands il faut servir leur ambition ou leurs plaisirs. Vous n’y réussirez jamais, car vous êtes sans naissance, et vous avez de la probité.

Paul : « Mais je ferai des actions si courageuses, je serai si fidèle à ma parole, si exact dans mes devoirs, si zélé et si constant dans mon amitié, que je mériterai d’être adopté par quelqu’un d’eux, comme j’ai vu que cela se pratiquoit dans les histoires anciennes que vous m’avez fait lire.

Le Vieillard : « Oh mon ami ! chez les Grecs et chez les Romains, même dans leur décadence, les grands avoient du respect pour la vertu ; mais nous avons eu une foule d’hommes célèbres en tout genre, sortis des classes du peuple, et je n’en sache pas un seul qui ait été adopté par une grande maison. La vertu, sa ns nos rois, seroit condamnée en France à être éternellement plébéienne. Comme je vous l’ai dit, ils la mettent quelquefois en honneur lorsqu’ils l’aperçoivent ; mais aujourd’hui les distinctions qui lui étoient réservées ne s’accordent plus que pour de l’argent.

Paul : « Au défaut d’un grand je chercherai à plaire à un corps. J’épouserai entièrement son esprit et ses opinions : je m’en ferai aimer.

Le Vieillard : « Vous ferez donc comme les autres hommes, vous renoncerez à votre conscience pour parvenir à la fortune ?

Paul : « Oh non ! je ne chercherai jamais que la vérité.

Le Vieillard : « Au lieu de vous faire aimer, vous pourriez bien vous faire haïr. D’ailleurs les corps s’intéressent fort peu à la découverte de la vérité. Toute opinion est indifférente aux ambitieux, pourvu qu’ils gouvernent.

Paul : "" Que je suis infortuné! tout me repousse. Je suis condamné à passer ma vie dans un travail obscur, loin de Virginie! Et il soupira profondément.

Le Vieillard : « Que Dieu soit votre unique patron, et le genre humain votre Corps ! Soyez constamment attaché à l’un et à l’autre. Les familles, les Corps, les peuples, les rois, ont leurs préjugés et leurs passions ; il faut souvent les servir par des vices. Dieu et le genre humain ne nous demandent que des vertus.

Mais pourquoi voulez-vous être distingué du reste des hommes ? C’est un sentiment qui n’est pas naturel, puisque, si chacun l’avoit, chacun seroit en état de guerre avec son voisin. Contentez-vous de remplir votre devoir dans l’état où la Providence vous a mis ; bénissez votre sort, qui vous permet d’avoir une conscience à vous, et qui ne vous oblige pas, comme les grands, de mettre votre bonheur dans l’opinion des petits, et comme les petits de ramper sous les grands pour avoir de quoi vivre. Vous êtes dans un pays et dans une condition où, pour subsister, vous n’avez besoin ni de tromper, ni de flatter, ni de vous avilir, comme font la plupart de ceux qui cherch ent la fortune en Europe ; où votre état ne vous interdit aucune vertu ; où vous pouvez être impunément bon, vrai, sincère, instruit, patient, tempérant, chaste, indulgent, pieux, sans qu’aucun ridicule vienne flétrir votre sagesse, qui n’est encore qu’en fleur. Le ciel vous a donné de la liberté, de la santé, une bonne conscience, et des amis : les rois, dont vous ambitionnez la faveur, ne sont pas si heureux.

Paul : « Ah ! il me manque Virginie ! Sans elle je n’ai rien ; avec elle j’aurois tout. Elle seule est ma naissance, ma gloire, et ma fortune. Mais puisque enfin sa parente veut lui donner pour mari un homme d’un grand nom, avec l’étude et des livres on devient savant et célèbre : je m’en vais étudier. J’acquerrai de la science ; je servirai utilement ma patrie par mes lumières, sans nuire à personne, et sans en dépendre ; je deviendrai fameux, et ma gloire n’appartiendra qu’à moi.

Le Vieillard : « Mon fils, les talents sont encore plus rares que la naissance et que les richesses ; et sans doute il s sont de plus grands biens, puisque rien ne peut les ôter, et que partout ils nous concilient l’estime publique : mais ils coûtent cher. On ne les acquiert que par des privations en tout genre, par une sensibilité exquise qui nous rend malheureux au-dedans, et au-dehors par les persécutions de nos contemporains. L’homme de robe n’envie point en France la gloire du militaire, ni le militaire celle de l’homme de mer ; mais tout le monde y traversera votre chemin, parce que tout le monde s’y pique d’avoir de l’esprit. Vous servirez les hommes, dites-vous ? Mais celui qui fait produire à un terrain une gerbe de blé de plus leur rend un plus grand service que celui qui leur donne un livre.

Paul : « Oh ! celle qui a planté ce papayer a fait aux habitants de ces forêts un présent plus utile et plus doux que si elle leur avoit donné une bibliothèque. » Et en même temps il saisit cet arbre dans ses bras, et le baisa avec transport.

Le Vieillard : « Le meilleur des livres, qui ne prêche que l’égalité, l’amitié, l’humanité, et la concorde, l’Évangile, a servi pendant des siècles de prétexte aux fureurs des Européens. Combien de tyrannies publiques et particulières s’exercent encore en son nom sur la terre ! Après cela, qui se flattera d’être utile aux hommes par un livre ? Rappelez-vous quel a été le sort de la plupart des philosophes qui leur ont prêché la sagesse. Homère, qui l’a revêtue de vers si beaux, demandoit l’aumône pendant sa vie. Socrate, qui en donna aux Athéniens de si aimables leçons par ses discours et par ses mœurs, fut empoisonné juridiquement par eux. Son sublime disciple Platon fut livré à l’esclavage par l’ordre du prince même qui le protégeoit : et avant eux, Pythagore, qui étendoit l’humanité jusqu’aux animaux, fut brûlé vif par les Crotoniates. Que dis-je ? la plupart même de ces noms illustres sont venus à nous défigurés par quelques traits de satire qui les caractérisent, l’ingratitude humaine se plaisant à les reconnoître là ; et si dans la foule la gloire de quelques-uns est venue nette et pure jusqu’à nous, c’est que ceux qui les ont portés ont vécu loin de la société de leurs contemporains : semblables à ces statues qu’on tire entières des champs de la Grèce et de l’Italie, et qui, pour avoir été ensevelies dans le sein de la terre, ont échappé à la fureur des barbares.

Vous voyez donc que, pour acquérir la gloire orageuse des lettres, il faut bien de la vertu, et être prêt à sacrifier sa propre vie. D’ailleurs, croyez-vous que cette gloire intéresse en France les gens riches ? Ils se soucient bien des gens de lettres, auxquels la science ne rapporte ni dignité dans la patrie, ni gouvernement, ni entrée à la cour. On persécute peu dans ce siècle indifférent à tout, hors à la fortune et aux voluptés ; mais les lumières et la vertu n’y mènent à rien de distingué, parce que tout est dans l’État le prix de l’argent. Autrefois elles trouvoient des récompenses assurées dans les différentes places de l’église, de la magistrature et de l’administration ; aujourd’hui elles ne servent qu’à faire des livres. Mais ce fruit, peu prisé des gens du monde, est toujours digne de son origine céleste. C’est à ces mêmes livres qu’il est réservé particulièrement de donner de l’éclat à la vertu obscure, de consoler les malheureux, d’éclairer les nations, et de dire la vérité même aux rois. C’est, sans contredit, la fonction la plus auguste dont le ciel puisse honorer un mortel sur la terre. Quel est l’homme qui ne se console de l’injustice ou du mépris de ceux qui disposent de la fortune, lorsqu’il pense que son ouvrage ira, de siècle en siècle et de nations en nations, servir de barrière à l’erreur et aux tyrans ; et que, du sein de l’obscurité où il a vécu, il jaillira une gloire qui effacera celle de la plupart des rois, dont les monuments périssent dans l’oubli, malgré les flatteurs qui les élèvent et qui les vantent ?

Paul : « Ah ! je ne voudrois cette gloire que pour la répandre sur Virginie, et la rendre chère à l’univers. Mais vous qui avez tant de connoissances, dites-moi si nous nous marierons ? Je voudrois être savant, au moins pour connoître l’avenir.

Le Vieillard : « Qui voudroit vivre, mon fils, s’il connoissoit l’avenir ? Un seul malheur prévu nous donne tant de vaines inquiétudes ! la vue d’un malheur certain empoisonneroit tous les jours qui le précéderoient. Il ne faut pas même trop approfondir ce qui nous envir onne ; et le ciel, qui nous donna la réflexion pour prévoir nos besoins, nous a donné les besoins pour mettre des bornes à notre réflexion.

Paul : « Avec de l’argent, dites-vous, on acquiert en Europe des dignités et des honneurs. J’irai m’enrichir au Bengale pour aller épouser Virginie à Paris. Je vais m’embarquer.

Le Vieillard : « Quoi ! vous quitteriez sa mère et la vôtre ?

Paul : «Vous m’avez vous-même donné le conseil de passer aux Indes.

Le Vieillard : « Virginie étoit alors ici. Mais vous êtes maintenant l’unique soutien de votre mère et de la sienne.

Paul : « Virginie leur fera du bien par sa riche parente.

Le Vieillard : « Les riches n’en font guère qu’à ceux qui leur font honneur dans le monde. Ils ont des parents bien plus à plaindre que madame de la Tour, qui, faute d’être secourus par eux, sacrifient leur liberté pour avoir du pain et passent leur vie renfermés dans des couvents.

Paul : « Quel pays que l’Europe ! Oh ! il faut que Virginie revienne ici. Qu’a-t-elle besoin d’avoir une parente riche ? Elle étoit si contente sous ces cabanes, si jolie et si bien parée avec un mouchoir rouge ou des fleurs autour de sa tête. Reviens, Virginie ! quitte tes hôtels et tes grandeurs. Reviens dans ces rochers, à l’ombre de ces bois et de nos cocotiers. Hélas ! tu es peut-être maintenant malheureuse ! » Et il se mettoit à pleurer. « Mon père, ne me cachez rien : si vous ne pouvez me dire si j’épouserai Virginie, au moins apprenez-moi si elle m’aime encore, au milieu de ces grands seigneurs qui parlent au roi, et qui la vont voir.

Le Vieillard : « Oh ! mon ami, je suis sûr qu’elle vous aime par plusieurs raisons, mais surtout parce qu’elle a de la vertu. » À ces mots il me sauta au cou, transporté de joie.

Paul : « Mais croyez-vous les femmes d’Europe fausses comme on les représente dans les comédies et dans les livres que vous m’avez prêtés ?

Le Vieillard : « Les femmes sont fausses dans les pays où les hommes sont tyrans. Partout la violence produit la ruse.

Paul : « Comment peut-on être tyran des femmes ?

Le Vieillard : « En les mariant sans les consulter, une jeune fille avec un vieillard, une femme sensible avec un homme indifférent.

Paul : « Pourquoi ne pas marier ensemble ceux qui se conviennent, les jeunes avec les jeunes, les amants avec les amantes ?

Le Vieillard : « C’est que la plupart des jeunes gens, en France, n’ont pas assez de fortune pour se marier, et qu’ils n’en acquièrent qu’en devenant vieux. Jeunes, ils corrompent les femmes de leurs voisins ; vieux, ils ne peuvent fixer l’affection de leurs épouses. Ils ont trompé, étant jeunes ; on les trompe à leur tour, étant vieux. C’est une des réactions de la justice universelle qui gouverne le monde. Un excès y balance toujours un autre excès. Ainsi la plupart des Européens passent leur vie dans ce double désordre, et ce désordre augmente dans une société à mesure que les richesses s’y accumulent sur un moindre nombre de têtes. L’État est semblable à un jardin, où les petits arbres ne peuvent venir s’il y en a de trop grands qui les ombragent ; mais il y a cette différence que la beauté d’un jardin peut résulter d’un petit nombre de grands arbres, et que la prospérité d’un État dépend toujours de la multitude et de l’égalité des sujets, et non pas d’un petit nombre de riches.

Paul : « Mais qu’est-il besoin d’être riche pour se marier ?

Le Vieillard : «Afin de passer ses jours dans l’abondance sans rien faire.

Paul : « Et pourquoi ne pas travailler ? Je travaille bien, moi.

Le Vieillard : «C’est qu’en Europe le travail des mains déshonore. On l’appelle travail mécanique. Celui même de labourer la terre y est le plus méprisé de tous. Un artisan y est bien plus estimé qu’un paysan.

Paul : « Quoi ! l’art qui nourrit les hommes est méprisé en Europe ! Je ne vous comprends pas.

Le Vieillard : « Oh ! il n’est pas possible à un homme élevé dans la nature de comprendre les dépravations de la société. On se fait une idée précise de l’ordre, mais non pas du désordre. La beauté, la vertu, le bonheur, ont des proportions ; la laideur, le vice, et le malheur, n’en ont point.

Paul : « Les gens riches sont donc bien heureux ! Ils ne trouvent d’obstacles à rien ; ils peuvent combler de plaisirs les objets qu’ils aiment.

Le Vieillard : « Ils sont la plupart usés sur tous les plaisirs, par cela même qu’ils ne leur coûtent aucunes p eines. N’avez-vous pas éprouvé que le plaisir du repos s’achète par la fatigue ; celui de manger, par la faim ; celui de boire, par la soif ? Eh bien ! celui d’aimer et d’être aimé ne s’acquiert que par une multitude de privations et de sacrifices. Les richesses ôtent aux riches tous ces plaisirs-là en prévenant leurs besoins. Joignez à l’ennui qui suit leur satiété l’orgueil qui naît de leur opulence, et que la moindre privation blesse lors même que les plus grandes jouissances ne le flattent plus. Le parfum de mille roses ne plaît qu’un instant ; mais la douleur que cause une seule de leurs épines dure longtemps après sa piqûre. Un mal au milieu des plaisirs est pour les riches une épine au milieu des fleurs. Pour les pauvres, au contraire, un plaisir au milieu des maux est une fleur au milieu des épines ; ils en goûtent vivement la jouissance. Tout effet augmente par son contraste. La nature a tout balancé. Quel état, à tout prendre, croyez-vous préférable, de n’avoir presque rien à espérer et tout à craindre, ou presque rien à craindre et tout à espérer ? Le premier état est celui des riches, et le second celui des pauvres. Mais ces extrêmes sont également. difficiles à supporter aux hommes dont le bonheur consiste dans la médiocrité et la vertu.

Paul : « Qu’entendez-vous par la vertu ?

Le Vieillard : « Mon fils ! vous qui soutenez vos parents par vos travaux, vous n’avez pas besoin qu’on vous la définisse. La vertu est un effort fait sur nous-mêmes pour le bien d’autrui dans l’intention de plaire à Dieu seul.

Paul : « Oh ! que Virginie est vertueuse ! C’est par vertu qu’elle a voulu être riche, afin d’être bienfaisante. C’est par vertu qu’elle est partie de cette île : la vertu l’y ramènera. »

L’idée de son retour prochain allumant l’imagination de ce jeune homme, toutes ses inquiétudes s’évanouissoient. Virginie n’avoit point écrit, parce qu’elle alloit arriver. Il falloit si peu de temps pour venir d’Europe avec un bon vent ! Il faisoit l’énumération des vaisseaux qui avoient fait ce trajet de quatre mille cinq cents lieues en moins de trois mois. Le vaisseau où elle s’étoit embarquée n’en mettroit pas plus de deux : les constructeurs étoient aujourd’ hui si savants, et les marins si habiles ! Il parloit des arrangements qu’il alloit faire pour la recevoir, du nouveau logement qu’il alloit bâtir, des plaisirs et des surprises qu’il lui ménageroit chaque jour quand elle seroit sa femme. Sa femme ! … cette idée le ravissoit. « Au moins, mon père, me disoit-il, vous ne ferez plus rien que pour votre plaisir. Virginie étant riche, nous aurons beaucoup de Noirs qui travailleront pour vous. Vous serez toujours avec nous, n’ayant d’autre souci que celui de vous amuser et de vous réjouir. » Et il alloit, hors de lui, porter à sa famille la joie dont il étoit enivré.

En peu de temps les grandes craintes succèdent aux grandes espérances. Les passions violentes jettent toujours l’âme dans les extrémités opposées. Souvent, dès le lendemain, Paul revenoit me voir, accablé de tristesse. Il me disoit : « Virginie ne m’écrit point. Si elle étoit partie d’Europe elle m’auroit mandé son départ. Ah ! les bruits qui ont couru d’elle ne sont que trop fondés ! sa tante l’a mariée à un grand seigneur. L’amour des richesses l’a perdue comme tant d’autres. Dans ces livres qui peignent si bien les femmes la vertu n’est qu’un sujet de roman. Si Virginie avoit eu de la vertu, elle n’auroit pas quitté sa propre mère et moi. Pendant que je passe ma vie à penser à elle, elle m’oublie. je m’afflige, et elle se divertit. Ah ! cette pensée me désespère. Tout travail me déplaît ; toute société m’ennuie. Plût à Dieu que la guerre fût déclarée dans l’Inde ! j’irais y mourir. »

« Mon fils, lui répondis-je, le courage qui nous jette dans la mort n’est que le courage d’un instant. Il est souvent excité par les vains applaudissements des hommes. Il en est un plus rare et plus nécessaire qui nous fait supporter chaque jour, sans témoin et sans éloge, les traverses de la vie ; c’est la patience. Elle s’appuie, non sur l’opinion d’autrui ou sur l’impulsion de nos passions, mais sur la volonté de Dieu. La patience est le courage de la vertu. »

« Ah ! s’écria-t-il, je n’ai donc point de vertu ! Tout m’accable et me désespère. — La vertu, repris-je, toujours égale, constante, invariable, n’est pas le partage de l’homme. Au milieu de tant de passions qui nous agitent, notre raison se trouble et s’obscurcit ; mais il est des phares où nous pouvons en rallumer le flambeau : ce sont les lettres.

Les lettres, mon fils, sont un secours du ciel. Ce sont des rayons de cette sagesse qui gouverne l’univers, que l’homme, inspiré par un art céleste, a appris à fixer sur la terre. Semblables aux rayons du soleil, elles éclairent, elles réjouissent, elles échauffent ; c’est un feu divin. Comme le feu, elles approprient toute la nature à notre usage. Par elles nous réunissons autour de nous les choses, les lieux, les hommes et les temps. Ce sont elles qui nous rappellent aux règles de la vie humaine. Elles calment les passions ; elles répriment les vices ; elles excitent les vertus par les exemples augustes des gens de bien qu’elles célèbrent, et dont elles nous présentent les images toujours honorées. Ce sont des filles du ciel qui descendent sur la terre pour charmer les maux du genre humain. Les grands écrivains qu’elles inspirent ont toujours paru dans les temps les plus difficiles à supporter à toute société, les temps de barbarie et ceux de dépravation. Mon fils, les lettres ont consolé une infinité d’hommes plus malheureux que vous : Xénophon, exilé de sa patrie après y avoir ramené dix mille Grecs ; Scipion l’Africain, lassé des calomnies des Romains ; Lucullus, de leurs brigues ; Catinat, de l’ingratitude de sa cour. Les Grecs, si ingénieux, avoient réparti à chacune des Muses qui président aux lettres une partie de notre entendement, pour le gouverner : nous devons donc leur donner nos passions à régir, afin qu’elles leur imposent un joug et un frein. Elles doivent remplir, par rapport aux puissances de notre âme, les mêmes fonctions que les Heures qui chevaux du Soleil.

Lisez donc, mon fils. Les sages qui ont écrit avant nous sont des voyageurs qui nous ont précédés dans les sentiers de l’infortune, qui nous tendent la main, et nous invitent à nous joindre à leur compagnie lorsque tout nous abandonne. Un bon livre est un bon ami. »

« Ah ! s’écrioit Paul, je n’avois pas besoin de savoir lire quand Virginie étoit ici. Elle n’avoit pas plus étudié que moi ; mais quand elle me regardoit en m’appelant son ami, il m’étoit impossible d’avoir du chagrin.  »

Sans doute, lui disois-je, il n’y a point d’ami aussi agréable qu’une maîtresse qui nous aime. Il y a de plus dans la femme une gaieté légère qui dissipe la tristesse de l’homme. Ses grâces font évanouir les noirs fantômes de la réflexion. Sur son visage sont les doux attraits et la confiance. Quelle joie n’est rendue plus vive par sa joie ? quel front ne se déride à son sourire ? quelle colère résiste à ses larmes ? Virginie reviendra avec plus de philosophie que vous n’en avez. Elle sera bien surprise de ne pas retrouver le jardin tout à fait rétabli, elle qui ne songe qu’à l’embellir, malgré les persécutions de sa parente, loin de sa mère et de vous.  »

L’idée du retour prochain de Virginie renouveloit le courage de Paul, et le ramenoit à ses occupations champêtres. Heureux au milieu de ses peines de proposer à son travail une fin qui plaisoit à sa passion !

Un matin, au point du jour (c’étoit le 24 décembre 1744), Paul, en se levant, aperçut un pavillon blanc arboré sur la montagne de la Découverte. Ce pavillon étoit le signalement d’un vaisseau qu’on voyoit en mer. Paul courut à la ville pour savoir s’il n’apportoit pas des nouvelles de Virginie. Il y resta jusqu’au retour du pilote du port, qui s’étoit embarqué pour aller le reconnoître, suivant l’usage. Cet homme ne revint que le soir. Il rapporta au gouverneur que le vaisseau signalé étoit le Saint-Géran, du port de 700 tonneaux, commandé par un capitaine appelé M. Aubin ; qu’il étoit à quatre lieues au large, et qu’il ne mouilleroit au Port Louis que le lendemain dans l’après-midi, si le vent étoit favorable. Il n’en faisoit point du tout alors. Le pilote remit au gouverneur les lettres que ce vaisseau apportoit de France. Il y en avoit une pour madame de la Tour, de l’écriture de Virginie. Paul s’en saisit aussitôt, la baisa avec transport, la mit dans son sein, et courut à l’habitation. Du plus loin qu’il aperçut la famille, qui attendoit son retour sur le rocher des Adieux, il éleva la lettre en l’air sans pouvoir parler ; et aussitôt tout le monde se rassembla chez madame de la Tour pour en entendre la lecture. Virginie mandoit à sa mère qu’elle avoit éprouvé beaucoup de mauvais procédés de la part de sa grand-tante, qui l’avoit voulu marier malgré elle, ensuite déshéritée, et enfin renvoyée dans un temps qui ne lui permettoit d’arriver à l’Ile de France que dans la saison des ouragans ; qu’elle avoit essayé en vain de la fléchir, en lui représentant ce qu’elle devoit à sa mère et aux habitudes du premier âge ; qu’elle en avoit été traitée de fille insensée dont la tête étoit gâtée par les romans ; qu’elle n’étoit maintenant sensible qu’au bonheur de revoir et d’embrasser sa chère famille, et qu’elle eût satisfait cet ardent désir dès le jour même, si le capitaine lui eût permis de s’embarquer dans la chaloupe du pilote ; mais qu’il s’étoit opposé à son départ à cause de l’éloignement de la terre, et d’une grosse mer qui régnoit au large, malgré le calme des vents.

À peine cette lettre fut lue que toute la famille, transportée de joie, s’écria : « Virginie est arrivée ! » Maîtresse et serviteurs, tous s’embrassèrent. Madame de la Tour dit à Paul : « Mon fils, allez prévenir notre voisin de l’arrivée de Virginie. » Aussitôt Domingue alluma un flambeau de bois de ronde, et Paul et lui s’acheminèrent vers mon habitation.

Il pouvoit être dix heures du soir. Je venois d’éteindre ma lampe et de me coucher, lorsque j’aperçus à travers les palissades de ma cabane une lumière dans les bois. Bientôt après j’entendis la voix de Paul qui m’appeloit. Je me lève ; et à peine j’étois habillé que Paul, hors de lui et tout essoufflé, me saute au cou en me disant : « Allons, allons ; Virginie est arrivée. Allons au port, le vaisseau y mouillera au point du jour.  »

Sur-le-champ nous nous mettons en route. Comme nous traversions les bois de la Montagne Longue, et que nous étions déjà sur le chemin qui mène des Pamplemousses au port, j’entendis quelqu’un marcher derrière nous. C’étoit un Noir qui s’avançoit à grands pas. Dès qu’il nous eut atteints je lui demandai d’où il venoit, et où il alloit en si grande hâte. Il me répondit : « Je viens du quartier de l’île appelé la Poudre d’Or : on m’envoie au port avertir le gouverneur qu’un vaisseau de France est mouillé sous l’île d’Ambre. Il tire du canon pour demander du secours, car la mer est bien mauvaise. » Cet homme ayant ainsi parlé continua sa route sans s’arrêter davantage.

Je dis alors à Paul : « Allons vers le quartier de la Poudre d’Or, au-devant de Virginie ; il n’y a que trois lieues d’ici. » Nous nous mîmes donc en route vers le nord de l’île. Il faisoit une chaleur étouffante. La lune étoit levée ; on voyoit autour d’elle trois grands cercles noirs. Le ciel étoit d’une obscurité affreuse. On distinguoit, à la lueur fréquente des éclairs, de longues files de nuages épais, sombres, peu élevés, qui s’entassoient vers le milieu de l’île, et venoient de la mer avec une grande vitesse, quoiqu’on ne sentît pas le moindre vent à terre. Chemin faisant nous crûmes entendre rouler le tonnerre ; mais ayant prêté l’oreille attentivement nous reconnûmes que c’étoient des coups de canon répétés par les échos. Ces coups de canon lointains, joints à l’aspect d’un ciel orageux, me firent frémir. Je ne pouvois douter qu’ils ne fussent les signaux de détresse d’un vaisseau en perdition. Une demi-heure après nous n’entendîmes plus tirer du tout ; et ce silence me parut encore plus effrayant que le bruit lugubre qui l’avoit précédé.

Nous nous hâtions d’avancer sans dire un mot, et sans oser nous communiquer nos inquiétudes. Vers minuit nous arrivâmes tout en nage sur le bord de la mer, au quartier de la Poudre d’Or. Les flots s’y brisoient avec un bruit épouvantable ; ils en couvroient les rochers et les grèves d’écume d’un blanc éblouissant et d’étincelles de feu. Malgré les ténèbres nous distinguâmes, à ces lueurs phosphoriques, les pirogues des pêcheurs qu’on avoit tirées bien avant sur le sable.

À quelque distance de là nous vîmes, à l’entrée du bois, un feu autour duquel plusieurs habitants s’étoient rassemblés. Nous fûmes nous y reposer en attendant le jour. Pendant que nous étions assis auprès de ce feu, un des habitants nous raconta que dans l’après-midi il avoit vu un vaisseau en pleine mer porté sur l’île par les courants ; que la nuit l’avoit dérobé à sa vue ; que deux heures après le coucher du soleil il l’avoit entendu tirer du canon pour appeler du secours, mais que la mer étoit si mauvaise qu’on n’avoit pu mettre aucun bateau dehors pour aller à lui ; que bientôt après il avoit cru apercevoir ses fanaux allumés, et que dans ce cas il craignoit que le vaisseau, venu si près du rivage, n’eût passé entre la terre et la petite île d’Ambre, prenant celle-ci pour le Coin de Mire, près duquel passent les vaisseaux qui arrivent au Port Louis ; que si cela étoit, ce qu’il ne pouvoit toutefois affirmer, ce vaisseau étoit dans le plus grand péril. Un autre habitant prit la parole, et nous dit qu’il avoit traversé plusieurs fois le canal qui sépare l’île d’Ambre de la côte ; qu’il l’avoit sondé, que la tenure et le mouillage en étoient très bons, et que le vaisseau y étoit en parfaite sûreté comme dans le meilleur port : « J’y mettrois toute ma fortune, ajouta-t-il, et j’y dormirois aussi tranquillement qu’à terre. » Un troisième habitant dit qu’il étoit impossible que ce vaisseau pût entrer dans ce canal, où à peine les chaloupes pouvoient naviguer. Il assura qu’il l’avoit vu mouiller au-delà de l’île d’Ambre, en sorte que si le vent venoit à s’élever au matin, il seroit le maître de pousser au large, ou de gagner le port. D’autres habitants ouvrirent d’autres opinions. Pendant qu’ils contestoient entre eux, suivant la coutume des Créoles oisifs, Paul et moi nous gardions un profond silence. Nous restâmes là jusqu’au petit point du jour ; mais il faisoit trop peu de clarté au ciel pour qu’on pût distinguer aucun objet sur la mer, qui d’ailleurs étoit couverte de brume : nous n’entrevîmes au large qu’un nuage sombre, qu’on nous dit être l’île d’Ambre, située à un quart de lieue de la côte. On n’apercevoit dans ce jour ténébreux que la pointe du rivage où nous étions, et quelques pitons des montagnes de l’intérieur de l’île, qui apparaissoient de temps en temps au milieu des nuages qui circuloient autour.

Vers les sept heures du matin nous entendîmes dans les bois un bruit de tambours : c’étoit le gouverneur, M. de la Bourdonnais, qui arrivoit à cheval, suivi d’un détachement de soldats armés de fusils, et d’un grand nombre d’habitants et de Noirs. Il plaça ses soldats sur le rivage, et leur ordonna de faire feu de leurs armes tous à la fois. À peine leur décharge fut faite que nous aperçûmes sur la mer une lueur, suivie presque aussitôt d’un coup de canon. Nous jugeâmes que le vaisseau étoit à peu de distance de nous, et nous courûmes tous du côté où nous avions vu son signal. Nous aperçûmes alors, à travers le brouillard, le corps et les vergues d’un grand vaisseau. Nous en étions si près que, malgré le bruit des flots, nous entendîmes le sifflet du maître qui commandoit la manœuvre, et les cris des matelots, qui crièrent trois fois Vive Le Roi ! car c’est le cri des Français dans les dangers extrêmes, ainsi que dans les grandes joies : comme si, dans les dangers, ils appeloient leur prince à leur secours, ou comme s’ils vouloient témoigner alors qu’ils sont prêts à périr pour lui.

Depuis le moment où le Saint-Géran aperçut que nous étions à portée de le secourir, il ne cessa de tirer du canon de trois minutes en trois minutes. M. de la Bourdonnais fit allumer de grands feux de distance en distance sur la grève, et envoya chez tous les habitants du voisinage chercher des vivres, des planches, des câbles, et des tonneaux vides. On en vit arriver bientôt une foule, accompagnés de leurs Noirs chargés de provisions et d’agrès, qui venoient des habitations de la Poudre d’Or, du quartier de Flacque, et de la Rivière du Rempart. Un des plus anciens de ces habitants s’approcha du gouverneur, et lui dit : « Monsieur, on a entendu toute la nuit des bruits sourds dans la montagne ; dans les bois les feuilles des arbres remuent sans qu’il fasse de vent ; les oiseaux de marine se réfugient à terre : certainement tous ces signes annoncent un ouragan. — Eh bien ! mes amis, répondit le gouverneur, nous y sommes préparés, et sûrement le vaisseau l’est aussi.  »

En effet tout présageoit l’arrivée prochaine d’un ouragan. Les nuages qu’on distinguoit au zénith étoient à leur centre d’un noir affreux, et cuivrés sur leurs bords. L’air retentissoit des cris des paille-en-culs, des frégates, des coupeurs d’eau, et d’une multitude d’oiseaux de marine, qui, malgré l’obscurité de l’atmosphère, venoient de tous les points de l’horizon chercher des retraites dans l’île.

Vers les neuf heures du matin on entendit du côté de la mer des bruits épouvantables, comme si des torrents d’eau, mêlés à des tonnerres, eussent roulé du haut des montagnes. Tout le monde s’écria : « Voilà l’ouragan ! » et dans l’instant un tourbillon affreux de vent enleva la brume qui couvraît l’île d’Ambre et son canal. Le Saint-Géran parut alors à découvert avec son pont chargé de monde, ses vergues et ses mâts de hune amenés sur le tillac, son pavillon en berne, quatre câbles sur son avant, et un de retenue sur son arrière. Il étoit mouillé entre l’île d’Ambre et la terre, en deçà de la ceinture de récifs qui entoure l’Ile de France, et qu’il avoit franchie par un endroit où jamais vaisseau n’avoit passé avant lui. Il présentoit son avant aux flots qui venoient de la pleine mer, et à chaque lame d’eau qui s’engageoit dans le canal, sa proue se soulevoit tout entière, de sorte qu’on en voyoit la carène en l’air ; mais dans ce mouvement sa poupe, venant à plonger, disparaissoit à la vue jusqu’au couronnement, comme si elle eût été submergée. Dans cette position où le vent et la mer le jetoient à terre, il lui étoit également impossible de s’en aller par où il étoit venu, ou, en coupant ses câbles, d’échouer sur le rivage, dont il étoit séparé par de hauts fonds semés de récifs. Chaque lame qui venoit briser sur la côte s’avançoit en mugissant jusqu’au fond des anses, et y jetoit des galets à plus de cinquante pieds dans les terres ; puis, venant à se retirer, elle découvroit une grande partie du lit du rivage, dont elle rouloit les cailloux avec un bruit rauque et affreux. La mer, soulevée par le vent, grossissoit à chaque instant, et tout le canal compris entre cette île et l’île d’Ambre n’étoit qu’une vaste nappe d’écumes blanches, creusées de vagues noires et profondes. Ces écumes s’amassoient dans le fond des anses à plus de six pieds de hauteur, et le vent, qui en balayoit la surface, les portoit par-dessus l’escarpement du rivage à plus d’une demi-lieue dans les terres. À leurs flocons blancs et innombrables, qui étoient chassés horizontalement jusqu’au pied des montagnes, on eût dit d’une neige qui sortoit de la mer. L’horizon offrait tous les signes d’une longue tempête ; la mer y paraissoit confondue avec le ciel. Il s’en détachoit sans cesse des nuages d’une forme horrible qui traversoient le zénith avec la vitesse des oiseaux, tandis que d’autres y paraissoient immobiles comme de grands rochers. On n’apercevoit aucune partie azurée du firmament ; une lueur olivâtre et blafarde éclairoit seule tous les objets de la terre, de la mer, et des cieux.

Dans les balancements du vaisseau, ce qu’on craignoit arriva. Les câbles de son avant rompirent ; et comme il n’étoit plus retenu que par une seule ansière, il fut jeté sur les rochers à une demi-encâblure du rivage. Ce ne fut qu’un cri de douleur parmi nous. Paul alloit s’élancer à la mer, lorsque je le saisis par le bras : « Mon fils, lui dis-je, voulez-vous périr ? — Que j’aille à son secours, s’écria-t-il, ou que je meure ! » Comme le désespoir lui ôtait la raison, pour prévenir sa perte, Domingue et moi lui attachâmes à la ceinture une longue corde dont nous saisîmes l’une des extrémités. Paul alors s’avança vers le Saint-Géran, tantôt nageant, tantôt marchant sur les récifs. Quelquefois il avoit l’espoir de l’aborder, car la mer, dans ses mouvements irréguliers, laissoit le vaisseau presque à sec, de manière qu’on en eût pu faire le tour à pied ; mais bientôt après, revenant sur ses pas avec une nouvelle furie, elle le couvroit d’énormes voûtes d’eau qui soulevoient tout l’avant de sa carène, et rejetoient bien loin sur le rivage le malheureux Paul, les jambes en sang, la poitrine meurtrie, et à demi noyé. À peine ce jeune homme avoit-il repris l’usage de ses sens qu’il se relevoit et retournoit avec une nouvelle ardeur vers le vaisseau, que la mer cependant entrouvroit par d’horribles secousses. Tout l’équipage, désespérant alors de son salut, se précipitoit en foule à la mer, sur des vergues, des planches, des cages à poules, des tables, et des tonneaux. On vit alors un objet digne d’une éternelle pitié : une jeune demoiselle parut dans la galerie de la poupe du Saint-Géran, tendant les bras vers celui qui faisoit tant d’efforts pour la joindre. C’étoit Virginie. Elle avoit reconnu son amant à son intrépidité. La vue de cette aimable personne, exposée à un si terrible danger, nous remplit de douleur et de désespoir. Pour Virginie, d’un port noble et assuré, elle nous faisait signe de la main, comme nous disant un éternel adieu. Tous les matelots s’étoient jetés à la mer. Il n’en restoit plus qu’un sur le pont, qui étoit tout nu et nerveux comme Hercule. Il s’approcha de Virginie avec respect : nous le vîmes se jeter à ses genoux, et s’efforcer même de lui ôter ses habits ; mais elle, le repoussant avec dignité, détourna de lui sa vue. On entendit aussitôt ces cris redoublés des spectateurs : « Sauvez-la, sauvez-la ; ne la quittez pas ! » Mais dans ce moment une montagne d’eau d’une effroyable grandeur s’engouffra entre l’île d’Ambre et la côte, et s’avança en rugissant vers le vaisseau, qu’elle menaçoit de ses flancs noirs et de ses sommets écumants. À cette terrible vue le matelot s’élança seul à la mer ; et Virginie, voyant la mort inévitable, posa une main sur ses habits, l’autre sur son cœur, et levant en haut des yeux sereins, parut un ange qui prend son vol vers les cieux.

Ô jour affreux ! hélas ! tout fut englouti. La lame jeta bien avant dans les terres une partie des spectateurs qu’un mouvement d’humanité avoit portés à s’avancer vers Virginie, ainsi que le matelot qui l’avoit voulu sauver à la nage. Cet homme, échappé à une mort presque certaine, s’agenouilla sur le sable, en disant : « Ô mon Dieu ! vous m’avez sauvé la vie ; mais je l’aurois donnée de bon cœur pour cette digne demoiselle qui n’a jamais voulu se déshabiller comme moi. » Domingue et moi nous retirâmes des flots le malheureux Paul sans connoissance, rendant le sang par la bouche et par les oreilles. Le gouverneur le fit mettre entre les mains des chirurgiens ; et nous cherchâmes de notre côté le long du rivage si la mer n’y apporteroit point le corps de Virginie : mais le vent ayant tourné subitement, comme il arrive dans les ouragans, nous eûmes le chagrin de penser que nous ne pourrions pas même rendre à cette fille infortunée les devoirs de la sépulture. Nous nous éloignâmes de ce lieu, accablés de consternation, tous l’esprit frappé d’une seule perte, dans un naufrage où un grand nombre de personnes avoient péri, la plupart doutant, d’après une fin aussi funeste d’une fille si vertueuse, qu’il existât une Providence ; car il y a des maux si terribles et si peu mérités, que l’espérance même du sage en est ébranlée.

Cependant on avoit mis Paul, qui commençoit à reprendre ses sens, dans une maison voisine, jusqu’à ce qu’il fût en état d’être transporté à son habitation. Pour moi, je m’en revins avec Domingue, afin de préparer la mère de Virginie et son amie à ce désastreux événement. Quand nous fûmes à l’entrée du vallon de la Rivière des Lataniers, des Noirs nous dirent que la mer jetoit beaucoup de débris du vaisseau dans la baie vis-à-vis. Nous y descendîmes ; et un des premiers objets que j’aperçus sur le rivage fut le corps de Virginie. Elle étoit à moitié couverte de sable, dans l’attitude où nous l’avions vue périr. Ses traits n’étoient point sensiblement altérés. Ses yeux étoient fermés ; mais la sérénité étoit encore sur son front : seulement les pâles violettes de la mort se confondoient sur ses joues avec les roses de la pudeur. Une de ses mains étoit sur ses habits, et l’autre, qu’elle appuyoit sur son cœur, étoit fortement fermée et roidie. J’en dégageai avec peine une petite boîte : mais quelle fut ma surprise lorsque je vis que c’étoit le portrait de Paul, qu’elle lui avoit promis de ne jamais abandonner tant qu’elle vivroit ! À cette dernière marque de la constance et de l’amour de cette fille infortunée, je pleurai amèrement. Pour Domingue, il se frappoit la poitrine, et perçoit l’air de ses cris douloureux. Nous portâmes le corps de Virginie dans une cabane de pêcheurs, où nous le donnâmes à garder à de pauvres femmes malabares, qui prirent soin de le laver.

Pendant qu’elles s’occupoient de ce triste office, nous montâmes en tremblant à l’habitation. Nous y trouvâmes madame de la Tour et Marguerite en prières, en attendant des nouvelles du vaisseau. Dès que madame de la Tour m’aperçut elle s’écria : « Où est ma fille, ma chère fille, mon enfant ? » Ne pouvant douter de son malheur à mon silence et à mes larmes, elle fut saisie tout à coup d’étouffements et d’angoisses douloureuses ; sa voix ne faisoit plus entendre que des soupirs et des sanglots. Pour Marguerite, elle s’écria : « Où est mon fils ? Je ne vois point mon fils »  ; et elle s’évanouit. Nous courûmes à elle ; et l’ayant fait revenir, je l’assurai que Paul étoit vivant, et que le gouverneur en faisoit prendre soin. Elle ne reprit ses sens que pour s’occuper de son amie qui tomboit de temps en temps dans de longs évanouissements. Madame de la Tour passa toute la nuit dans ces cruelles souffrances ; et par leurs longues périodes j’ai jugé qu’aucune douleur n’étoit égale à la douleur maternelle. Quand elle recouvroit la connoissance elle tournoit des regards fixes et mornes vers le ciel. En vain son amie et moi nous lui pressions les mains dans les nôtres, en vain nous l’appelions par les noms les plus tendres ; elle paraissoit insensible à ces témoignages de notre ancienne affection, et il ne sortoit de sa poitrine oppressée que de sourds gémissements.

Dès le matin on apporta Paul couché dans un palanquin. Il avoit repris l’usage de ses sens ; mais il ne pouvoit proférer une parole. Son entrevue avec sa mère et madame de la Tour, que j’avois d’abord redoutée, produisit un meilleur effet que tous les soins que j’avois pris jusqu’alors. Un rayon de consolation parut sur le visage de ces deux malheureuses mères. Elles se mirent l’une et l’autre auprès de lui, le saisirent dans leurs bras, le baisèrent ; et leur larmes, qui avoient été suspendues jusqu’alors par l’excès de leur chagrin, commencèrent à couler. Paul y mêla bientôt les siennes. La nature s’étant ainsi soulagée dans ces trois infortunés, un long assoupissement succéda à l’état convulsif de leur douleur, et leur procura un repos léthargique semblable, à la vérité, à celui de la mort.

M. de la Bourdonnais m’envoya avertir secrètement que le corps de Virginie avoit été apporté à la ville par son ordre, et que de là on alloit le transférer à l’église des Pamplemousses. Je descendis aussitôt au Port Louis, où je trouvai des habitants de tous les quartiers rassemblés pour assister à ses funérailles, comme si l’île eût perdu en elle ce qu’elle avoit de plus cher. Dans le port les vaisseaux avoient leurs vergues croisées, leurs pavillons en berne, et tiroient du canon par longs intervalles. Des grenadiers ouvroient la marche du convoi ; ils portoient leurs fusils baissés. Leurs tambours, couverts de longs crêpes, ne faisoient entendre que des sons lugubres, et on voyoit l’abattement peint dans les traits de ces guerriers qui avoient tant de fois affronté la mort dans les combats sans changer de visage. Huit jeunes demoiselles des plus considérables de l’île, vêtues de blanc, et tenant des palmes à la main, portoient le corps de leur vertueuse compagne, couvert de fleurs. Un chœur de petits enfants le suivoit en chantant des hymnes : après eux venoit tout ce que l’île avoit de plus distingué dans ses habitants et dans son état-major, à la suite duquel marchoit le gouverneur, suivi de la foule du peuple.

Voilà ce que l’administration avoit ordonné pour rendre quelques honneurs à la vertu de Virginie. Mais quand son corps fut arrivé au pied de cette montagne, à la vue de ces mêmes cabanes dont elle avoit fait si longtemps le bonheur, et que sa mort remplissoit maintenant de désespoir, toute la pompe funèbre fut dérangée : les hymnes et les chants cessèrent ; on n’entendit plus dans la plaine que des soupirs et des sanglots. On vit accourir alors des troupes de jeunes filles des habitations voisines pour faire toucher au cercueil de Virginie des mouchoirs, des chapelets, et des couronnes de fleurs, en l’invoquant comme une sainte. Les mères demandoient à Dieu une fille comme elle ; les garçons, des amantes aussi constantes ; les pauvres, une amie aussi tendre ; les esclaves, une maîtresse aussi bonne.

Lorsqu’elle fut arrivée au lieu de sa sépulture, des négresses de Madagascar et des Cafres de Mozambique déposèrent autour d’elle des paniers de fruits, et suspendirent des pièces d’étoffes aux arbres voisins, suivant l’usage de leur pays ; des Indiennes du Bengale et de la côte malabare apportèrent des cages pleines d’oiseaux, auxquels elles donnèrent la liberté sur son corps : tant la perte d’un objet aimable intéresse toutes les nations, et tant est grand le pouvoir de la vertu malheureuse, puisqu’elle réunit toutes les religions autour de son tombeau !

Il fallut mettre des gardes auprès de sa fosse, et en écarter quelques filles de pauvres habitants, qui vouloient s’y jeter à toute force, disant qu’elles n’avoient plus de consolation à espérer dans le monde, et qu’il ne leur restoit qu’à mourir avec celle qui étoit leur unique bienfaitrice.

On l’enterra près de l’église des Pamplemousses, sur son côté occidental, au pied d’une touffe de bambous, où, en venant à la messe avec sa mère et Marguerite, elle aimoit à se reposer assise à côté de celui qu’elle appeloit alors son frère.

Au retour de cette pompe funèbre M. de la Bourdonnais monta ici, suivi d’une partie de son nombreux cortège. Il offrit à madame de la Tour et à son amie tous les secours qui dépendoient de lui. Il s’exprima en peu de mots, mais avec indignation, contre sa tante dénaturée ; et s’approchant de Paul, il lui dit tout ce qu’il crut propre à le consoler. « Je désirois, lui dit-il, votre bonheur et celui de votre famille ; Dieu m’en est témoin. Mon ami, il faut aller en France ; je vous y ferai avoir du service. Dans votre absence j’aurai soin de votre mère comme de la mienne », et en même temps il lui présenta la main ; mais Paul retira la sienne, et détourna la tête pour ne le pas voir.

Pour moi, je restai dans l’habitation de mes amies infortunées pour leur donner, ainsi qu’à Paul, tous les secours dont j’étois capable. Au bout de trois semaines Paul fut en état de marcher ; mais son chagrin paraissoit augmenter à mesure que son corps reprenoit des forces. Il étoit insensible à tout, ses regards étoient éteints, et il ne répondoit rien à toutes les questions qu’on pouvoit lui faire. Madame de la Tour, qui étoit mourante, lui disoit souvent : « Mon fils, tant que je vous verrai, je croirai voir ma chère Virginie. » À ce nom de Virginie il tressailloit et s’éloignoit d’elle, malgré les invitations de sa mère qui le rappeloit auprès de son amie. Il alloit seul se retirer dans le jardin, et s’asseyoit au pied du cocotier de Virginie, les yeux fixés sur sa fontaine. Le chirurgien du gouverneur, qui avoit pris le plus grand soin de lui et de ces dames, nous dit que pour le tirer de sa noire mélancolie il falloit lui laisser faire tout ce qu’il lui plairoit, sans le contrarier en rien ; qu’il n’y avoit que ce seul moyen de vaincre le silence auquel il s’obstinoit.

Je résolus de suivre son conseil. Dès que Paul sentit ses forces un peu rétablies, le premier usage qu’il en fit fut de s’éloigner de l’habitation. Comme je ne le perdois pas de vue, je me mis en marche après lui, et je dis à Domingue de prendre des vivres et de nous accompagner. À mesure que ce jeune homme descendoit cette montagne, sa joie et ses forces sembloient renaître. Il prit d’abord le chemin des Pamplemousses ; et quand il fut auprès de l’église, dans l’allée des bambous, il s’en fut droit au lieu où il vit de la terre fraîchement remuée ; là il s’agenouilla, et levant les yeux au ciel il fit une longue prière. Sa démarche me parut de bon augure pour le retour de sa raison, puisque cette marque de confiance envers l’Etre Suprême faisait voir que son âme commençoit à reprendre ses fonctions naturelles. Domingue et moi nous nous mîmes à genoux à son exemple, et nous priâmes avec lui. Ensuite il se leva, et prit sa route vers le nord de l’île, sans faire beaucoup d’attention à nous. Comme je savois qu’il ignoroit non seulement où on avoit déposé le corps de Virginie, mais même s’il avoit été retiré de la mer, je lui demandai pourquoi il avoit été prier Dieu au pied de ces bambous : il me répondit, « Nous y avons été si souvent !  »

Il continua sa route jusqu’à l’entrée de la forêt, où la nuit nous surprit. Là, je l’engageai, par mon exemple, à prendre quelque nourriture ; ensuite nous dormîmes sur l’herbe au pied d’un arbre. Le lendemain je crus qu’il se détermineroit à revenir sur ses pas. En effet il regarda quelque temps dans la plaine l’église des Pamplemousses avec ses longues avenues de bambous, et il fit quelques mouvements comme pour y retourner ; mais il s’enfonça brusquement dans la forêt, en dirigeant toujours sa route vers le nord. Je pénétrai son intention, et je m’efforçai en vain de l’en distraire. Nous arrivâmes sur le milieu du jour au quartier de la Poudre d’Or. Il descendit précipitamment au bord de la mer, vis-à-vis du lieu où avoit péri le Saint-Géran. À la vue de l’île d’Ambre, et de son canal alors uni comme un miroir, il s’écria : « Virginie ! ô ma chère Virginie ! » et aussitôt il tomba en défaillance. Domingue et moi nous le portâmes dans l’intérieur de la forêt, où nous le fîmes revenir avec bien de la peine. Dès qu’il eut repris ses sens il voulut retourner sur les bords de la mer ; mais l’ayant supplié de ne pas renouveler sa douleur et la nôtre par de si cruels ressouvenirs, il prit une autre direction. Enfin pendant huit jours il se rendit dans tous les lieux où il s’étoit trouvé avec la compagne de son enfance. Il parcourut le sentier par où elle avoit été demander la grâce de l’esclave de la Rivière Noire ; il revit ensuite les bords de la rivière des Trois-Mamelles, où elle s’assit ne pouvant plus marcher, et la partie du bois où elle s’étoit égarée. Tous les lieux qui lui rappeloient les inquiétudes, les jeux, les repas, la bienfaisance de sa bien-aimée ; la rivière de la Montagne Longue, ma petite maison, la cascade voisine, le papayer qu’elle avoit planté, les pelouses où elle aimoit à courir, les carrefours de la forêt où elle se plaisoit à chanter, firent tour à tour couler ses larmes ; et les mêmes échos, qui avoient retenti tant de fois de leurs cris de joie communs, ne répétoient plus maintenant que ces mots douloureux : « Virginie ! ô ma chère Virginie !  »

Dans cette vie sauvage et vagabonde ses yeux se cavèrent, son teint jaunit, et sa santé s’altéra de plus en plus. Persuadé que le sentiment de nos maux redouble par le souvenir de nos plaisirs, et que les passions s’accroissent dans la solitude, je résolus d’éloigner mon infortuné ami des lieux qui lui rappeloient le souvenir de sa perte, et de le transférer dans quelque endroit de l’île où il y eût beaucoup de dissipation. Pour cet effet je le conduisis sur les hauteurs habitées du quartier de Williams, où il n’avoit jamais été. L’agriculture et le commerce répandoient dans cette partie de l’île beaucoup de mouvement et de variété. Il y avoit des troupes de charpentiers qui équarrissoient des bois, et d’autres qui les scioient en planches ; des voitures alloient et venoient le long de ses chemins ; de grands troupeaux de bœufs et de chevaux y paissoient dans de vastes pâturages, et la campagne y étoit parsemée d’habitations. L’élévation du sol y permettoit en plusieurs lieux la culture de diverses espèces de végétaux de l’Europe. On y voyoit çà et là des moissons de blé dans la plaine, des tapis de fraisiers dans les éclaircis des bois, et des haies de rosiers le long des routes. La fraîcheur de l’air, en donnant de la tension aux nerfs, y étoit même favorable à la santé des Blancs. De ces hauteurs, situées vers le milieu de l’île, et entourées de grands bois, on n’apercevoit ni la mer, ni le Port Louis, ni l’église des Pamplemousses, ni rien qui pût rappeler à Paul le souvenir de Virginie. Les montagnes mêmes, qui présentent différentes branches du côté du Port Louis, n’offrent plus du côté des plaines de Williams qu’un long promontoire en ligne droite et perpendiculaire, d’où s’élèvent plusieurs longues pyramides de rochers où se rassemblent les nuages.

Ce fut donc dans ces plaines où je conduisis Paul. Je le tenois sans cesse en action, marchant avec lui au soleil et à la pluie, de jour et de nuit, l’égarant exprès dans les bois, les défrichés, les champs, afin de distraire son esprit par la fatigue de son corps, et de donner le change à ses réflexions par l’ignorance du lieu où nous étions, et du chemin que nous avions perdu. Mais l’âme d’un amant retrouve partout les traces de l’objet aimé. La nuit et le jour, le calme des solitudes et le bruit des habitations, le temps même qui emporte tant de souvenirs, rien ne peut l’en écarter. Comme l’aiguille touchée de l’aimant, elle a beau être agitée, dès qu’elle rentre dans son repos, elle se tourne vers le pôle qui l’attire. Quand je demandois à Paul, égaré au milieu des plaines de Williams : « Où irons-nous maintenant ? » il se tournoit vers le nord, et me disoit : « Voilà nos montagnes, retournons-y.  »

Je vis bien que tous les moyens que je tentois pour le distraire étoient inutiles, et qu’il ne me restoit d’autre ressource que d’attaquer sa passion en elle-même, en y employant toutes les forces de ma foible raison. Je lui répondis donc : « Oui, voilà les montagnes où demeuroit votre chère Virginie, et voilà le portrait que vous lui aviez donné, et qu’en mourant elle portoit sur son cœur, dont les derniers mouvements ont encore été pour vous. »

Je présentai alors à Paul le petit portrait qu’il avoit donné à Virginie au bord de la fontaine des cocotiers. À cette vue une joie funeste parut dans ses regards. Il saisit avidement ce portrait de ses faibles mains, et le porta sur sa bouche. Alors sa poitrine s’oppressa, et dans ses yeux à demi sanglants des larmes s’arrêtèrent sans pouvoir couler.

Je lui dis : « Mon fils, écoutez-moi, qui suis votre ami, qui ai été celui de Virginie, et qui, au milieu de vos espérances, ai souvent tâché de fortifier votre raison contre les accidents imprévus de la vie. Que déplorez-vous avec tant d’amertume ? est-ce votre malheur ? est-ce celui de Virginie ?

Votre malheur ? Oui, sans doute, il est grand. Vous avez perdu la plus aimable des filles, qui auroit été la plus digne des femmes. Elle avoit sacrifié ses intérêts aux vôtres, et vous avoit préféré à la fortune comme la seule récompense digne de sa vertu. Mais que savez-vous si l’objet de qui vous deviez attendre un bonheur si pur n’eût pas été pour vous la source d’une infinité de peines ? Elle étoit sans bien, et déshéritée ; vous n’aviez désormais à partager avec elle que votre seul travail. Revenue plus délicate par son éducation, et plus courageuse par son malheur même, vous l’auriez vue chaque jour succomber, en s’ efforçant de partager vos fatigues. Quand elle vous auroit donné des enfants, ses peines et les vôtres auroient augmenté par la difficulté de soutenir seule avec vous de vieux parents, et une famille naissante.

Vous me direz : le gouverneur nous auroit aidés. Que savez-vous si, dans une colonie qui change si souvent d’administrateurs, vous aurez souvent des La Bourdonnais ? S’il ne viendra pas ici des chefs sans mœurs et sans morale ? si, pour obtenir quelque misérable secours, votre épouse n’eût pas été obligée de leur faire sa cour ? Ou elle eût été foible, et vous eussiez été à plaindre ; ou elle eût été sage, et vous fussiez resté pauvre : heureux si, à cause de sa beauté et de sa vertu, vous n’eussiez pas été persécuté par ceux mêmes de qui vous espériez de la protection !

Il me fût resté, me direz-vous, le bonheur, indépendant de la fortune, de protéger l’objet aimé qui s’attache à nous à proportion de sa faiblesse même ; de le consoler par mes propres inquiétudes ; de le réjouir de ma tristesse, et d’accroître notre amour de nos peines mutuelles. Sans doute la vertu et l’amour jouissent de ces plaisirs amers. Mais elle n’est plus, et il vous reste ce qu’après vous elle a le plus aimé, sa mère et la vôtre, que votre douleur inconsolable conduira au tombeau. Mettez votre bonheur à les aider, comme elle l’y avoit mis, elle-même. Mon fils, la bienfaisance est le bonheur de la vertu ; il n’y en a point de plus assuré et de plus grand sur la terre. Les projets de plaisirs, de repos, de délices, d’abondance, de gloire, ne sont point faits pour l’homme foible, voyageur et passager. Voyez comme un pas vers la fortune nous a précipités tous d’abîme en abîme. Vous vous y êtes opposé, il est vrai ; mais qui n’eût pas cru que le voyage de Virginie devoit se terminer par son bonheur et par le vôtre ? Les invitations d’une parente riche et âgée, les conseils d’un sage gouverneur, les applaudissements d’une colonie, les exhortations et l’autorité d’un prêtre, ont décidé du malheur de Virginie. Ainsi nous courons à notre perte, trompés par la prudence même de ceux qui nous gouvernent. Il eût mieux valu sans doute ne pas les croire, ni se fier à la voix et aux espérances d’un monde trompeur. Mais enfin, de tant d’hommes que nous voyons si occupés dans ces plaines, de tant d’autres qui vont chercher la fortune aux Indes, ou qui, sans sortir de chez eux, jouissent en repos en Europe des travaux de ceux-ci, il n’y en a aucun qui ne soit destiné à perdre un jour ce qu’il chérit le plus, grandeurs, fortune, femme, enfants, amis. La plupart auront à joindre à leur perte le souvenir de leur propre imprudence. Pour vous, en rentrant en vous-même, vous n’avez rien à vous reprocher. Vous avez été fidèle à votre foi. Vous avez eu, à la fleur de la jeunesse, la prudence d’un sage, en ne vous écartant pas du sentiment de la nature. Vos vues seules étoient légitimes, parce qu’elles étoient pures, simples, désintéressées, et que vous aviez sur Virginie des droits sacrés qu’aucune fortune ne pouvoit balancer. Vous l’avez perdue, et ce n’est ni votre imprudence, ni votre avarice, ni votre fausse sagesse, qui vous l’ont fait perdre, mais Dieu même, qui a employé les passions d’autrui pour vous ôter l’objet de votre amour ; Dieu, de qui vous tenez tout, qui voit tout ce qui vous convient, et dont la sagesse ne vous laisse aucun lieu au repentir et au désespoir qui marchent à la suite des maux dont nous avons été la cause.

Voilà ce que vous pouvez vous dire dans votre infortune : Je ne l’ai pas méritée. Est-ce donc le malheur de Virginie, sa fin, son état présent, que vous déplorez ? Elle a subi le sort réservé à la naissance, à la beauté, et aux empires mêmes. La vie de l’homme, avec tous ses projets, s’élève comme une petite tour dont la mort est le couronnement. En naissant, elle étoit condamnée à mourir. Heureuse d’avoir dénoué les liens de la vie avant sa mère, avant la vôtre, avant vous, c’est-à-dire de n’être pas morte plusieurs fois avant la dernière !

La mort, mon fils, est un bien pour tous les hommes ; elle est la nuit de ce jour inquiet qu’on appelle la vie. C’est dans le sommeil de la mort que reposent pour jamais les maladies, les douleurs, les chagrins, les craintes qui agitent sans cesse les malheureux vivants. Examinez les hommes qui paraissent les plus heureux : vous verrez qu’ils ont acheté leur prétendu bonheur bien chèrement ; la considération publique, par des maux domestiques ; la fortune, par la perte de la santé ; le plaisir si rare d’être aimé, par des sacrifices continuels : et souvent, à la fin d’une vie sacrifiée aux intérêts d’autrui, ils ne voient autour d’eux que des amis faux et des parents ingrats. Mais Virginie a été heureuse jusqu’au dernier moment. Elle l’a été avec nous par les biens de la nature ; loin de nous, par ceux de la vertu : et même dans le moment terrible où nous l’avons vue périr elle étoit encore heureuse ; car, soit qu’elle jetât les yeux sur une colonie entière à qui elle causoit une désolation universelle, ou sur vous qui couriez avec tant d’intrépidité à son secours, elle a vu combien elle nous étoit chère à tous. Elle s’est fortifiée contre l’avenir par le souvenir de l’innocence de sa vie, et elle a reçu alors le prix que le ciel réserve à la vertu, un courage supérieur au danger. Elle a présenté à la mort un visage serein.

Mon fils, Dieu donne à la vertu tous les événements de la vie à supporter, pour faire voir qu’elle seule peut en faire usage, et y trouver du bonheur et de la gloire. Quand il lui réserve une réputation illustre, il l’élève sur un grand théâtre, et la met aux prises avec la mort ; alors son courage sert d’exemple, et le souvenir de ses malheurs reçoit à jamais un tribut de larmes de la postérité. Voilà le monument immortel qui lui est réservé sur une terre où tout passe, et où la mémoire même de la plupart des rois est bientôt ensevelie dans un éternel oubli.

Mais Virginie existe encore. Mon fils, voyez que tout change sur la terre, et que rien ne s’y perd. Aucun art humain ne pourroit anéantir la plus petite particule de matière, et ce qui fut raisonnable, sensible, aimant, vertueux, religieux, auroit péri, lorsque les éléments dont il étoit revêtu sont indestructibles ? Ah ! si Virginie a été heureuse avec nous, elle l’est maintenant bien davantage. Il y a un Dieu, mon fils : toute la nature l’annonce ; je n’ai pas besoin de vous le prouver. Il n’y a que la méchanceté des hommes qui leur fasse nier une justice qu’ils craignent. Son sentiment est dans votre cœur, ainsi que ses ouvrages sont sous vos yeux. Croyez-vous donc qu’il laisse Virginie sans récompense ? Croyez-vous que cette même puissance qui avoit revêtu cette âme si noble d’une forme si belle, où vous sentiez un art divin, n’auroit pu la tirer des flots ? que celui qui a arrangé le bonheur actuel des hommes par des lois que vous ne connoissez pas, ne puisse en préparer un autre à Virginie par des lois qui vous sont également inconnues ? Quand nous étions dans le néant, si nous eussions été capables de penser, aurions-nous pu nous former une idée de notre existence ? Et maintenant que nous sommes dans cette existence ténébreuse et fugitive, pouvons-nous prévoir ce qu’il y a au-delà de la mort par où nous en devons sortir ? Dieu a-t-il besoin, comme l’homme, du petit globe de notre terre pour servir de théâtre à son intelligence et à sa bonté, et n’a-t-il pu propager la vie humaine que dans les champs de la mort ? Il n’y a pas dans l’océan une seule goutte d’eau qui ne soit pleine d’êtres vivants qui ressortissent à nous, et il n’existeroit rien pour nous parmi tant d’astres qui roulent sur nos têtes ? Quoi ! il n’y auroit d’intelligence suprême et de bonté divine précisément que là où nous sommes ; et dans ces globes rayonnants et innombrables, dans ces champs infinis de lumière qui les environnent, que ni les orages ni les nuits n’obscurcissent jamais, il n’y auroit qu’un espace vain et un néant éternel ? Si nous, qui ne nous sommes rien donné, osions assigner des bornes à la puissance de laquelle nous avons tout reçu, nous pourrions croire que nous sommes ici sur les limites de son empire, où la vie se débat avec la mort, et l’innocence avec la tyrannie ?

Sans doute il est quelque part un lieu où la vertu reçoit sa récompense. Virginie maintenant est heureuse. Ah ! si du séjour des anges elle pouvoit se communiquer a vous, elle vous diroit Comme dans ses adieux : « Ô Paul ! la vie n’est qu’une épreuve. J’ai été trouvée fidèle aux lois de la nature, de l’amour, et de la vertu. J’ai traversé les mers pour obéir à mes parents ; j’ai renoncé aux richesses pour conserver ma foi ; et j’ai mieux aimé perdre la vie que de violer la pudeur. Le ciel a trouvé ma carrière à la pauvreté, à la calomnie, aux tempêtes, au spectacle des douleurs d’autrui. Aucun des maux qui effrayent les hommes ne peut plus désormais m’atteindre ; et vous me plaignez ! Je suis pure et inaltérable comme une particule de lumière ; et vous me rappelez dans la nuit de la vie ! Ô Paul ! ô mon ami ! souviens-toi de ces jours de bonheur, où dès le matin nous goûtions la volupté des cieux, se levant avec le soleil sur les pitons de ces rochers, et se répandant avec ses rayons au sein de nos forêts. Nous éprouvions un ravissement dont nous ne pouvions comprendre la cause. Dans nos souhaits innocents nous désirions être tout vue, pour jouir des riches couleurs de l’aurore ; tout odorat, pour sentir les parfums de nos plantes ; tout ouïe pour entendre les concerts de nos oiseaux ; tout cœur, pour reconnoître ces bienfaits. Maintenant à la source de la beauté d’où découle tout ce qui est agréable sur la terre, mon âme voit, goûte, entend, touche immédiatement ce qu’elle ne pouvoit sentir alors que par de faibles organes. Ah ! quelle langue pourroit décrire ces rivages d’un orient éternel que j’habite pour toujours ? Tout ce qu’une puissance infinie et une bonté céleste ont pu créer pour consoler un être malheureux ; tout ce que l’amitié d’une infinité d’êtres, réjouis de la même félicité, peut mettre d’harmonie dans des transports communs, nous l’éprouvons sans mélange. Soutiens donc l’épreuve qui t’est donnée, afin d’accroître le bonheur de ta Virginie par des amours qui n’auront plus de terme, par un hymen dont les flambeaux ne pourront plus s’éteindre. Là j’apaiserai tes regrets ; là j’essuierai tes larmes. Ô mon ami ! mon jeune époux ! élève ton âme vers l’infini pour supporter des peines d’un moment.  »

Ma propre émotion mit fin à mon discours. Pour Paul, me regardant fixement, il s’écria : « Elle n’est plus ! elle n’est plus ! » et une longue faiblesse succéda à ces douloureuses paroles. Ensuite, revenant à lui, il dit : « Puisque la mort est un bien, et que Virginie est heureuse, je veux aussi mourir pour me rejoindre à Virginie. » Ainsi mes motifs de consolation ne servirent qu’à nourrir son désespoir. J’étois comme un homme qui veut sauver son ami coulant à fond au milieu d’un fleuve sans vouloir nager. La douleur l’avoit submergé. Hélas ! les malheurs du premier âge préparent l’homme à entrer dans la vie, et Paul n’en avoit jamais éprouvé.

Je le ramenai à son habitation. J’y trouvai sa mère et madame de la Tour dans un état de langueur qui avoit encore augmenté. Marguerite étoit la plus abattue. Les caractères vifs sur lesquels glissent les peines légères sont ceux qui résistent le moins aux grands chagrins.

Elle me dit : « Ô mon bon voisin ! il m’a semblé cette nuit voir Virginie vêtue de blanc, au milieu de bocages et de jardins délicieux. Elle m’a dit : « Je jouis d’un bonheur digne d’envie. Ensuite elle s’est approchée de Paul d’un air riant, et l’a enlevé avec elle. Comme je m’efforçois de retenir mon fils, j’ai senti que je quittois moi-même la terre, et que je le suivois avec un plaisir inexprimable. Alors j’ai voulu dire adieu à mon amie ; aussitôt je l’ai vue qui nous suivoit avec Marie et Domingue. Mais ce que je trouve encore de plus étrange, c’est que madame de la Tour a fait cette même nuit un songe accompagné des mêmes circonstances.  »

Je lui répondis : « Mon amie, je crois que rien n’arrive dans le monde sans la permission de Dieu. Les songes annoncent quelquefois la vérité.  »

Madame de la Tour me fit le récit d’un songe tout à fait semblable qu’elle avoit eu cette même nuit. Je n’avois jamais remarqué dans ces deux dames aucun penchant à la superstition ; je fus donc frappé de la concordance de leur songe, et je ne doutai pas en moi-même qu’il ne vint à se réaliser. Cette opinion, que la vérité se présente quelquefois à nous pendant le sommeil, est répandue chez tous les peuples de la terre. Les plus grands hommes de l’Antiquité y ont ajouté foi, entre autres Alexandre, César, les Scipions, les deux Catons et Brutus, qui n’étoient pas des esprits faibles. L’Ancien et le Nouveau Testament nous fournissent quantité d’exemples de songes qui se sont réalisés. Pour moi, je n’ai besoin à cet égard que de ma propre expérience, et j’ai éprouvé plus d’une fois que les songes sont des avertissements que nous donne quelque intelligence qui s’intéresse à nous. Que si l’on veut combattre ou défendre avec des raisonnements des choses qui surpassent la lumière de la raison humaine, c’est ce qui n’est pas possible. Cependant si la raison de l’homme n’est qu’une image de celle de Dieu, puisque l’homme a bien le pouvoir de faire parvenir ses intentions jusqu’au bout du monde par des moyens secrets et cachés, pourquoi l’intelligence qui gouverne l’univers n’en emploieroit-elle pas de semblables pour la même fin ? Un ami console son ami par une lettre qui traverse une multitude de royaumes, circule au milieu des haines des nations, et vient apporter de la joie et de l’espérance à un seul homme ; pourquoi le souverain protecteur de l’innocence ne peut-il venir, par quelque voie secrète, au secours d’une âme vertueuse qui ne met sa confiance qu’en lui seul ? A-t-il besoin d’employer quelque signe extérieur pour exécuter sa volonté, lui qui agit sans cesse dans tous ses ouvrages par un travail intérieur ?

Pourquoi douter des songes ? La vie, remplie de tant de projets passagers et vains, est-elle autre chose qu’un songe ?

Quoi qu’il en soit, celui de mes amies infortunées se réalisa bientôt. Paul mourut deux mois après la mort de sa chère Virginie, dont il prononçoit sans cesse le nom. Marguerite vit venir sa fin huit jours après celle de son fils avec une joie qu’il n’est donné qu’à la vertu d’éprouver. Elle fit les plus tendres adieux à madame de la Tour, « dans l’espérance, lui dit-elle, d’une douce et éternelle réunion. La mort est le plus grand des biens, ajouta-t-elle ; on doit la désirer. Si la vie est une punition, on doit en souhaiter la fin ; si c’est une épreuve, on doit la demander courte. »

Le gouvernement prit soin de Domingue et de Marie, qui n’étoient plus en état de servir, et qui ne survécurent pas longtemps à leurs maîtresses. Pour le pauvre Fidèle, il étoit mort de langueur à peu près dans le même temps que son maître.

J’amenai chez moi madame de la Tour, qui se soutenoit au milieu de si grandes pertes avec une grandeur d’âme incroyable. Elle avoit consolé Paul et Marguerite jusqu’au dernier instant, comme si elle n’avoit eu que leur malheur à supporter. Quand elle ne les vit plus, elle m’en parloit chaque jour comme d’amis chéris qui étoient dans le voisinage. Cependant elle ne leur survécut que d’un mois. Quant à sa tante, loin de lui reprocher ses maux, elle prioit Dieu de les lui pardonner, et d’apaiser les troubles affreux d’esprit où nous apprîmes qu’elle étoit tombée immédiatement après qu’elle eut renvoyé Virginie avec tant d’inhumanité.

Cette parente dénaturée ne porta pas loin la punition de sa dureté. J’appris, par l’arrivée successive de plusieurs vaisseaux, qu’elle étoit agitée de vapeurs qui lui rendoient la vie et la mort également insupportables.

Tantôt elle se reprochoit la fin prématurée de sa charmante petite-nièce, et la perte de sa mère qui s’en étoit suivie. Tantôt elle s’applaudissoit d’avoir repoussé loin d’elle deux malheureuses qui, disoit-elle, avoient déshonoré sa maison par la bassesse de leurs inclinations. Quelquefois, se mettant en fureur à la vue de ce grand nombre de misérables dont Paris est rempli : « Que n’envoie-t-on, s’écrioit-elle, ces fainéants périr dans nos colonies ? » Elle ajoutoit que les idées d’humanité, de vertu, de religion, adoptées par tous les peuples n’étoient que des inventions de la politique de leurs princes. Puis, se jetant tout à coup dans une extrémité opposée, elle s’abandonnoit à des terreurs superstitieuses qui la remplissoient de frayeurs mortelles. Elle couroit porter d’abondantes aumônes à de riches moines qui la dirigeoient, les suppliant d’apaiser la Divinité par le sacrifice de sa fortune : comme si des biens qu’elle avoit refusés aux malheureux pouvoient plaire au père des hommes ! Souvent son imagination lui représentoit des campagnes de feu, des montagnes ardentes, où des spectres hideux erroient en l’appelant à grands cris. Elle se jetoit aux pieds de ses directeurs, et elle imaginoit contre elle-même des tortures et des supplices ; car le ciel, le juste ciel, envoie aux âmes cruelles des religions effroyables.

Ainsi elle passa plusieurs années, tour à tour athée et superstitieuse, ayant également en horreur la mort et la vie. Mais ce qui acheva la fin d’une si déplorable existence fut le sujet même auquel elle avoit sacrifié les sentiments de la nature. Elle eut le chagrin de voir que sa fortune passeroit après elle à des parents qu’elle haïssait. Elle chercha donc à en aliéner la meilleure partie ; mais ceux-ci, profitant des accès de vapeurs auxquels elle étoit sujette, la firent enfermer comme folle, et mettre ses biens en direction. Ainsi ses richesses mêmes achevèrent sa perte ; et comme elles avoient endurci le cœur de celle qui les possédoit, elles dénaturèrent de même le cœur de ceux qui les désiroient. Elle mourut donc, et, ce qui est le comble du malheur, avec assez d’usage de sa raison pour connoître qu’elle étoit dépouillée et méprisée par les mêmes personnes dont l’opinion l’avoit dirigée toute sa vie.

On a mis auprès de Virginie, au pied des mêmes roseaux, son ami Paul, et autour d’eux leurs tendres mères et leurs fidèles serviteurs. On n’a point élevé de marbres sur leurs humbles tertres, ni gravé d’inscriptions à leurs vertus ; mais leur mémoire est restée ineffaçable dans le cœur de ceux qu’ils ont obligés. Leurs ombres n’ont pas besoin de l’éclat qu’ils ont fui pendant leur vie ; mais si elles s’intéressent encore à ce qui se passe sur la terre, sans doute elles aiment à errer sous les toits de chaume qu’habite la vertu laborieuse, à consoler la pauvreté mécontente de son sort, à nourrir dans les jeunes amants une flamme durable, le goût des biens naturels, l’amour du travail, et la crainte des richesses.

La voix du peuple, qui se tait sur les monuments élevés à la gloire des rois, a donné à quelques parties de cette île des noms qui éterniseront la perte de Virginie. On voit près de l’île d’Ambre, au milieu des écueils, un lieu appelé La passe du Saint-Géran, du nom de ce vaisseau qui y périt en la ramenant d’Europe. L’extrémité de cette longue pointe de terre que vous apercevez à trois lieues d’ici, à demi couverte des flots de la mer, que le Saint-Géran ne put doubler la veille de l’ouragan pour entrer dans le port, s’appelle le cap malheureux ; et voici devant nous, au bout de ce vallon, La baie du tombeau, Où Virginie fut trouvée ensevelie dans le sable ; comme si la mer eût voulu rapporter son corps à sa famille, et rendre les derniers devoirs à sa pudeur sur les mêmes rivages qu’elle avoit honorés de son innocence.

Jeunes gens si tendrement unis ! mères infortunées ! chère famille ! ces bois qui vous donnoient leurs ombrages, ces fontaines qui couloient pour vous, ces coteaux où vous reposiez ensemble, déplorent encore votre perte. Nul depuis vous n’a osé cultiver cette terre désolée, ni relever ces humbles cabanes. Vos chèvres sont devenues sauvages ; vos vergers sont détruits ; vos oiseaux sont enfuis, et on n’entend plus que les cris des éperviers qui volent en rond au haut de ce bassin de rochers. Pour moi, depuis que je ne vous vois plus, je suis comme un ami qui n’a plus d’amis, comme un père qui a perdu ses enfants, comme un voyageur qui erre sur la terre, où je suis resté seul.

En disant ces mots ce bon vieillard s’éloigna en versant des larmes, et les miennes avoient coulé plus d’une fois pendant ce funeste récit.Embed"

But remember its the little things that count
So buy her flowers
Surprise her with candy
She loves chocolate but not the dark kind
So make sure you don't give her that
Or she'll give you this grumpy look that's sexy but still mean business

She has a great sense of humor
She is loyal beyond belief
Has more beauty than meets the eye and a smile that could end a war
So admire everything about her
Even the way her eyes wrinkle in the corner every time she smiles
She's more of an indoors type of girl
She likes to stay home, watch tv, relax and cuddle up
But that doesn't mean she doesn't like to go out
So take her to a fancy dinner, a funny movie, or even a picnic at the park
Just don't make the same mistakes as me

Don't take her for granted
Don't flirt with other girls when you get bored
And don't you dare mess up your second chance when she gives you one
Why? Because she's that loving and loyal she will give you one
And don't you dare make her cry
Because her tears are the most depressing thing you could ever witness
And if you do make her cry be there for her
Hold her and apologize, as she grabs your shirt and pushes her face into your chest
Console her and make a promise that you're going to do better and actually keep it
Most importantly
Don't make the same mistake as me
Don't
Don't
Don't sleep with other girls!1Embed"

I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without bein' disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without bein' disrespectful
Damn, girl

[Chorus]
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch
Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch
Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch
Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines (Ah-ha) working that Photoshop (Ah-ha)
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (Ah-ha), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma, she told me, ""Don't worry about your size""

Awake in my dreams
The morning feels now
And I'm wide asleep
Those movies of love sound
Don't tell it like this
I took my best shot
So, why did I miss?

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I let it all go?
Let it all go now?
Let it take toll
Let it take toll
Should I run to your door?
Tell you I'm so sorry
I wanna change the ending of the story

[Chorus]
Take me back
To the days of summer
Back to being lovers
To the times I thought the sun won't set
Take me back
Let's forgive each other
Let the rains of summer
Come pouring down
And wash our problems away

Take me to evergreen
Everlasting sunset
Like the sky on fire
Remember how it feels
Taking back the days
To “once upon a time”
Yeah
Watching those movies that we never liked
The credits are rolling
Let's not say goodbye
Oooh oh oh
Ooh oh no-no

Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
""I love you, boo"", ""I love you too""
""I miss you a lot"", ""I miss you even more""
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say

Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', ""Who the hell?!""

Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing

I never really had the guts to look under that log
I need them all, all, all to love me
But they see through me so easy
I wish I could believe in your God
Sounds fun, we could throw rocks out of heaven
I get these dark thoughts every day now
I never thought I'd be that one
Good news, I'm way too scared to do it
And I have too much fun being scared

I'm in this for life
Like it or not
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
You will have to drag me by the neck

I'm not gonna bail
Writing on the ceiling of the box while the coffin is nailed
California dreamin' while the demons are hot on our tail
Hop a curb, yes, that was me off of the trail, officer
No, I don't have a good reason
I was just in a mood to go seekin'
Heard a hard poem, it had my heart thumpin'
Start my blood pumpin' again

Part II: Untitled Spoken Word Poem
I dreamed I understood myself completely
We were having a party in a house falling out of the sky
Every clique showed up
The ones who love the smell of gasoline
The shy beautifuls
The microphone eaters
The gimme gimme gimmes
The maybe next years
The boring childhooders who trashed their lives for fun
The house rotated as it made it through the storm
Eyeball-sized hail sailed sideways through the windows
As the single pane, survived-the-great-fire hundred-year-old glass all smashed
We laughed and dropped the hailstones in our drinks and danced
We started chanting something optimistic that we knew was maybe mostly bullshit
That if we even still felt one-tenth of one percent how we felt in that moment in the morning
That it would be an energy that could shake neighborhoods from their foundations
We dragged ourselves on a twenty-mile mission to fill our goblets in the kitchen
I got stopped by a hallway goblin named Frank
Who said he once dreamed Karl Marx and Rosa Parks were beating the shit out of him
Which gave him a full-body orgasm
I told him my dad analyzes dreams for a living and believes they're portals to the subconscious
And I believe him and I don't judge you, we're all weirdos
My dad still refuses to drive Beemers because they made cars for Hitler
But I always suspected that that was convenient logic
For a family that could only afford used station wagons
I told him how in a drawer in my house I found a matchbook from my dad's 1955 Bar Mitzvah
It still had nine dry unused matches that hadn't been torn from the cardboard
It's a time machine and remains my second most prized possession
Do you understand this, Frank?
You're in the presence of a motherfucker who owns fire from the past
Can you imagine getting high with a flame from 1955? Can you?
Do you feel connected to your ancestors? Do you?
Do you ever feel strange? Wonder how the world's gaze has shaped you?
Do you fear being shaken by the shoulders like an Etch A Sketch
Being mugged for your memories? I do
They are my first most prized possession
My very first memory was sitting in a high chair with my brother the day the Bay ripped in two
The earthquake shook the china from the shelves and we clapped because we didn't understand
I told him how my mother's father died in a plane crash
I told him how my brother grew up to be a pilot
And then the captain, which apparently the building had and was my brother
Came over the intercom, which apparently the building had
And alerted the party that the house was starting to spin faster
And soon it would be time for us to hit the ground
So either buckle your seatbelts, say your prayers
Or find someone who wants to fuck you
China was smashing against the ceiling
Me and Frank said our goodbyes easily once I realized I'd been having a conversation in the mirror the whole time
I climbed out a window, clung to a drainpipe, and watched the stars paint the sky
Part III: Boxes
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

I see the ghosts on every corner
Of the people that we used to be
So many that they sit upon the shoulders of their brothers and their sisters
As our city slips into the sea

Danny in a DC tee gettin' stomped in the head on Clement Street
Kids in the black boots
Dad's got the long hair, Dad's gettin' hired, gettin' fired
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom's got my pills in a paper bag, bills on the table
That's before they were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back

Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

We were already fading, we just didn't know it yet
Holdin' onto the lie of my perfection tucked under my arm like a late Blockbuster cassette
And fuck yeah, I was hard for Miss Popular
Been jockin' her but she couldn't see where I sat with binoculars
Binaca stashed in my pocket, shot my good shot, the good Lord, she blocked it
Cherish the small tragedies
The big ones are smokin' out in the bathroom and loiterin' for the moment when nobody sees 'em comin'
An openin' they can jump in and make a total catastrophe
My family tried to hold it together
But now that we can't hold it together
We'll hold each other closer instead

Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

Danny in the deep blue sea getting wasted on the MUNI out to DP
Kids with the tall cans
Dad's got the short hair, Dad's not retired quite yet
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom plays guitar and she sings to us at night
That was before we were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back

Little boxes on the hillside
There's a blue one and a yellow one
And they all look just the same1Embed"

JERRY: New clothes?

GEORGE: Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?

JERRY: Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!

GEORGE: The guy never came back.

JERRY: He asked you to watch them not wear them.

GEORGE: I'm still watching them.

JERRY: You look like a tourist.

GEORGE: All right, let me ask you something: When do you start to worry about ear hair?

JERRY: When you hear like a soft russeling.

GEORGE: It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.

JERRY: Oh right, the new job, how is it?
GEORGE: I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.

JERRY: So who's the new you?

ELAINE: Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.

KRAMER: You put my life's stories in his autobiography?

ELAINE: Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.

KRAMER: Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.

MR. LIPPMAN: So you just eat the tops.

ELAINE: Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.

Two men forcefully pick Kramer up and push him out of the store.

KRAMER: I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.

George is walking down the street looking down at his map. He is bumping into people.

MAN 1: Try looking up hayseed.

MAN 2: You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.

MARY ANNE: Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.

GEORGE: Well actually I'm...

MARY ANNE: I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?

GEORGE: Little Rock, Arkensas.

MARY ANNE: Ooh.

JERRY IS IN HIS BATHROOM SHAVING. HE THINKS. HE TILTS THE MIRROR DOWN.

JERRY: Hmm. That looks new.

He thinks some more. He picks up his razor.

KRAMER: So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.

JERRY: (uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.

KRAMER: What's the matter with you?

JERRY: (uncomfortably) Nothing.

KRAMER: No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.

JERRY: I did something stupid.

KRAMER: What did you do?

JERRY: Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.

KRAMER: Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.

JERRY: Well women do it.

KRAMER: (high pitched voice) ""Well women do it."" I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.

JERRY: Well what am I going to tell Alex?

KRAMER: Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?

JERRY: Um hum.

George enters

KRAMER: Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.

JERRY: Hey!

KRAMER: I forgot. Wait. Never mind.

Jerry and Alex walking.

ALEX: How about the beach this weekend?

JERRY: You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...

ALEX: All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE WALKS INTO A MUFFIN SHOP

ELAINE: ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?

MR. LIPPMAN: Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!

ELAINE: Mr Lippman?

GEORGE AND JERRY AT JERRY'S APARTMENT.

JERRY: So you're pretending to be a tourist?

GEORGE: It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup

JERRY: How do you explain your apartment?

GEORGE: I got a hotel room.

JERRY: you moved into a hotel?

GEORGE: Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?

JERRY: So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.

GEORGE: Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?

JERRY: Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.

Kramer is in a school bus. He honks his horn. Camera shot down on the bus.

KRAMER: (yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.

Jerry pulls up the blinds on his upstairs window and looks down.

KRAMER: (yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.

GEORGE: Reality tour?

JERRY: The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.

ELAINE AT THE MUFFIN SHOP

ELAINE: This was my idea you stole my idea.

MR. LIPPMAN: Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.

ELAINE: Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.

MR. LIPPMAN: You want a muffin or not?

ELAINE: Peach.

GERGE AND MARY ANNE AT MONKS

MARY ANNE: So I notice you don't have much of an accent.

GEORGE: Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.

MARY ANNE: Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.

GEORGE: Willie. Yeah.

MARY ANNE: And I'm still going to be here.

GEORGE: Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?

MARY ANNE: (laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.

JERRY: You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.

GEORGE: Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.

JERRY: What is it she think you can't do?

GEORGE: Find a job. Get an apartment.

JERRY: How did you do those things?

GEORGE: Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.

JERRY: Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?

KRAMER: Here you go, here you go, check it out.

JERRY: ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.

KRAMER: Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.

JERRY: Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.

KRAMER: I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.

GEORGE: What's desert?

KRAMER: Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.

GEORGE: He eats those?

KRAMER: No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.

GEORGE: I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.

KRAMER: Talk to me.

GEORGE: But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.

KRAMER: Understand?

JERRY: Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.

ELAINE AND MR. LIPPMAN AT MONK'S

MR. LIPPMAN: Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.

ELAINE: So? What do you want me to do about it?

MR. LIPPMAN: You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.

ELAINE: Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...

MR. LIPPMAN: What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?

ELAINE: Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.

MR. LIPPMAN: Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?

ELAINE: Yeah.

MR. LIPPMAN: So what do we with the bottoms?

ELAINE: I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.

MR. LIPPMAN: That's a good idea.

ELAINE: And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""

MR. LIPPMAN: No. No. It is.

AT JERRY'S APARTMENT

KRAMER: Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?

JERRY: What? Can't I get a moment's peace?

KRAMER: What are you doing to yourself?

Jerry walks into camera view with his chest covered with shaving cream.

JERRY: I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.

KRAMER: You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.

JERRY: Oh that's an old wives tale.

KRAMER: Is it? Look at this.

Kramer walks off-screen and opens his shirt. On-screen, Jerry reels from the sight.

KRAMER: (high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.

JERRY: Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.

KRAMER: Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?

ELAINE AT THE MUFFIN SHOP

ELAINE: Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.

LIPPMAN: Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.

REBECCA: Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.

ELAINE: Oh, hi.

REBECCA: Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?

ELAINE: You been enjoying them?

REBECCA: They're just stumps.

ELAINE: Well they're perfectly edible.

REBECCA: Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?

MR. LIPPMAN: No no, we just thought...

REBECCA: I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.

ELAINE: If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.

REBECCA: The homeless don't like them.

ELAINE: Fine.

REBECCA: We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?""

ELAINE: We were just trying to help.

REBECCA: Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.

ELAINE: I think I might.

MARY ANNE AND GEORGE AT GEORGE'S ""NEW"" APARTMENT.

MARY ANNE: I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?

GEORGE: $2300.

MARY ANNE: Ouch. A month?

GEORGE: Yeah.

MARY ANNE: Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.

GEORGE: Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.

MARY ANNE: Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.

Mary Anne exits. George sniffs his armpit.
ON KRAMER'S BUS.

KRAMER: Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.

WOMAN: Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.

KRAMER: (over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.

MAN 1: Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.

KRAMER: Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.

MAN 2: Who's Newman?

MAN 3: Who cares.

MAN 4: Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious.

MAN 1: Can I have his candy bar?

KRAMER: Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.

AT JERRY'S APARTMENT.

JERRY: Why do I have to go on the tour?

KRAMER: Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.

Elaine enters

JERRY: Hey, how's business?

ELAINE: Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.

KRAMER: All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.

ELAINE: Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: You got any room on that thing?

KRAMER: Yeah there are a few seats still available.

ELAINE: Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.

KRAMER: Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.

ELAINE: No they don't.

KRAMER: Are they war veterans?

Elaine looks at him confused.
IN GEORGE'S OFFICE.

MARY ANNE: Wow this is your office.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.

MARY ANNE: Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?

GEORGE: Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)

MR. STEINBRENNER: Wait a minute George.

GEORGE: Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the ""o""'s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown.

ON KRAMER'S BUS.

ALEX: You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.

JERRY: You also shouldn't use a donut.

Kramer gets on the bus. He starts the tape player playing banjo music.

KRAMER: All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...

TAPE PLAYER: Turn music off.

JERRY: Can we just go?

KRAMER: And go we will.

MAN: What is this? A piece of pound cake?

KRAMER: We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.

MAN 2: We're going to a garbage dump?

KRAMER: And we're off.

JERRY: You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.

MR. STEINBRENNER IS SITTING AT HIS DESK ON THE PHONE WITH THE MANAGER AT TYLER CHICKEN WHO IS ALSO SITTING AT HIS DESK.

MR. STEINBRENNER: (the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.

JOHN TYLER: (the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.

MR. STEINBRENNER: Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?

JOHN TYLER: How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.

MR. STEINBRENNER: How do you make that alcoholic chicken?

JOHN TYLER: Let if ferment, just like everything else.

MR. STEINBRENNER: That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.

KRAMER AT A GARBAGE DUMP CARRYING A GARBAGE BAG.

MAN: Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?

KRAMER: I was going to dump this.

MAN: It doesn't look like garbage.

KRAMER: Well it's muffin stumps

MAN: Where are the muffin tops?

KRAMER: This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.

MAN: Can't do it.

KRAMER: Is this a joke?

MAN: That's what I'd like to know about it.

ALEX: You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?

JERRY: What's that?

ALEX: Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.

JERRY: Oh. Yeah.

KRAMER: (gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.

MAN: Where are we going?

KRAMER: (looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.

Banjo music plays as they look for garbage dumps.
NEXT SCENE. KRAMER ARGUES WITH SOMEONE AT A DUMP.
NEXT SCENE. A MAN VOMITS ON THE FLOOR.
NEXT SCENE. KRAMER IS DRIVING. HE IS SLEEPY. HIS HEAD NODS DOWN ONTO THE HORN. THE HORN BLOWS. STARTLED, KRAMER SITS BACK UP. BANJO MUSIC FINISHES.

WAITRESS: So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.

GEORGE: Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.

MAN: Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?

GEORGE: What clothes?

MAN: These clothes. The ones you're wearing.

ON KRAMER'S BUS

JERRY: (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.

KRAMER: Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.

JERRY: I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.

Kramer gets off the bus, carrying a garbage bag.
Eerie music is playing. Jerry looks out the bus window at a full moon. A dog starts barking.

JERRY: I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.

KRAMER: I don't know where the tops are.

Jerry runs past Kramer and another person. Eerie music still playing.

KRAMER: Jerry what's the matter?

In slow motion Jerry runs into the woods. At normal speed he runs behind a tree. Camera shot down on him as he starts scratching his chest.

JERRY: (for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.

BARTENDER: Hey, you looking for George?

MARY ANNE: Yeah.

BARTENDER: He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.

GEORGE: (talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.

MARY ANNE: I told you this city would eat you alive.

AT THE MUFFIN SHOP.

MR. LIPPMAN: What is this guy again?

ELAINE: They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.

Newman enters.

NEWMAN: Hello Elaine. Where are they?

ELAINE: In the back.

NEWMAN: All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.

MR. LIPPMAN: What is going on here?

NEWMAN: If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.

Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 4 bottles of milk and sets them down. He bites into a stump, then takes a drink of milk from the glass. (continuity error: he never actually poured the glass of milk.) He swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. He takes another stump.Embed"

I will not play the part I will not separate from my heart
Catch the spark between the synapse gaps it never lasts
But never the less man it's a blast vibin' fast tippin' my hat
Quickly came off the rack
And slowly started counting my stacks
This is peace
Money said the universe whack
I'm on track
And trust me they ain't ready for the attack
Deep water dwelling I just cut a little slack
Yeah they rise to the top like pollution overlapped
I'm too done with they crap watch it
Bubble off back into the ethers deep
Inside a golden teacher eat it quickly for reapers open your doorstep
More or less I choose death
At least I'm happy in the moment this moment is all that's left
For love of life is just another attitude of gratitude
And I'm gratefully dead
Gloriously in the amber hue
Phone full of missed calls
Alone and I'm pissed off
Cup of strong and its tipped off
I'm already faded
I regret that I kissed you
Even more that I hit too
I been drinking since two
So before I O.D. lemme say

I guess I'm addicted to more then pills
I'm tripping off more then just drugs
I gotta be real
And after the feel
Can't forget the meals
But you got outta your head let me out in the rain
But the thing is I tried to explain
I wished I could turn things around but I just burned things
Cause let's be real here I can do better
Tell me have you thought that lately?
Bet you thought I wouldn't do better
So if I move on what does that make me?
Does that make me like you
You said you would always be here
Always have my back where you at now

[Verse 2: Solo]
Born to be famous
Show you I'm amazing
Ether rappers I been blazing
Baby
I been contemplating
I made it work
Drive me hella crazy
Thunder god I'm going Raiden
Frozen faces trapped in stasis
Goddess of the light guide my caravan
Show me the world
Take my hand
I can barely stand
Don't have a plan to understand I need a couple grand
This world is ours I'll share my powers
You can take command
So why should we slack
Gave you my hours I'm taking em back
The point of attack
I'm alone no more packs
Don't know em who's after me
Show me the map
I arrive as man
Made to start at the end
I ascended we blended
My visions extended
Who gave you the power
I heard that he lent it
Use and dispose me
I been apprehended
I saw your intentions
I still learned a lesson
I trusted a weapon
Emotions pretending
Worthless contender
Who you offending
Fuck your suggestions
Whoever you blessing
Condemned this my sentence
Recommended to fall to dementia
Can't escape from the cold in a sweater
I've spoke to the weather
We've been doing betterEmbed"

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

But what we were best at were pop culture hypotheticals, wildly imagined scenarios whose possibilities were so intriguing that the next day we'd continue the conversation right where we'd left off  without  missing a beat, without even first saying hello. We'd wonder who would win if Bruce Lee fought Heavyweight champ Larry Holmes; what would happen if the shark from Jaws somehow got in the community swimming pool through the metal drain at the bottom of  the deep end; how awesome it would be if Christie Brinkley was our babysitter; or if  the rumor  was true that Bon Scott was not dead at all, but bearded and sad and rot­ting away in  a Mexican prison,  and if  it was, maybe we should head down there and do something about it.

The  bus  stop  was like a  bar  but  without  any of  the drinks, though the conversations we had did prefigure the kind of  drunken musings we would have years later as college students. Of  course we knew our endless combinations of  preposterous  pop  culture  pairings and  bizarre, almost supernatural wishes (''And then Jim Morrison would jump down from the sky right on the stage with wings made of snakes and be like, 'I was never dead""') were never going to come true, but they were so inspired, so sublimely hallucinogenic, they made us glow with excitement because they felt like the newest and best ideas on the planet. And as outrageous and illogical as they were, they felt real enough to happen and that was what made them so seductive.

But the fact was, Bruce Lee was dead, and even if  he wasn't, it was doubtful  he'd come  out  of  retirement  and jump both sports and weight classes to fight Larry Holmes; the metal drain at the bottom of the pool was too small for even a baby barracuda to get in; my babysitter was Lisa Gates, a girl who didn't look to be even in the same species as Christie Brinkley; and if Bon Scott really was in a Mexican Prison, and five seventh graders from California somehow slipped under the parental radar and made their way down to Tijuana on a school day, what could they really do once they got there?

Reality, however, has not dampened my desire, even into my thirties, to think of  the world in the same terms I did when I was a kid at the bus stop. But instead of  dreaming up things that fancifully mutate reality, I have now become obsessed with reality itself, and what might have happened if it hadn't gotten in the way. For example, if River Phoenix hadn't died of a drug overdose; if the Smiths hadn't broken up; or if Bjorn Borg hadn't retired from tennis at twenty-six. Of  course these are all great artists and athletes who left their marks with deep indentations on popular culture, but the mind just takes off when it thinks about what more they could have done: Phoenix was deepening as an actor and his body of work seemed to only scratch the surface of what he was really capable of; the Smiths' last studio album Strangeways Here We Come was their most accessible yet; and Borg had eleven Grand  Slam titles when he walked away from the sport, which at the time was only two shy of Roy Emerson's record.

As for me, an ardent  music addict with far too  many arcane facts easily accessed by the right question and with a music collection so absurdly sizable I can listen to a differ­ent album every day for the next fifty-five years, for me what hurts the most is the story of  the Stone Roses.l On the strength of  their self-titled debut  album, the Stone Roses should not only have ruled the world, they should still be ruling it. Shrugging off time and history and the constantly evolving musical curves  of  the  pop  universe, the  Stone Roses' harmonious blend of melodic six-string pop and psy­chedelic rock and roll still remains, after all these years, both fresh and vital. Whether it's the slithering, narcissistic arro­gance of ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" the soaring chorus of ""She Bangs the  Drums,''  or  the  funky workout  of  ""Elephant Stone,"" The  Stone Roses has more  highlights than  a David Beckham career retrospective. But more than that, it's a cohesive album, an album not Frankensteined together with one hit single and an array of scraps disguised as songs, but an album whose seamlessly sequenced song cycle begins by devilishly taunting, ""I  don't  have to  sell my soul  / He's already in me,'' and then nervily ends with the self-obsessed and deliciously arrogant declaration ""I am the Resurrection and I am the Light."" True to the words of its bookends, the entire album is pompous and defiant, each song crackling with ambition and hunger.

The Stone Roses' debut finds that lone, peerless groove occupied in temporary installments by precious few super­stars, that  groove  where everything clicks and  hums  and snaps into place, and even the mistakes look good. In other words, when you've got it, you've got it big and it was here that the Stone Roses had it. Even experimental dalliances with backward recording, or a minute-long number set to an old English folk song about assassinating the Queen some­how  work.  The  mastery  of  this  period  for  the  band  is evinced on  the  songs that  didn't  even make it on  to the record. In fact, not only are the b-sides as good, if  not in some cases better  than  the singles they backed, I'm con­vinced that  the Stone  Roses were so untouchable  at this point  in  their career that  a recording of  the  band  eating lunch would have been a hit single.

Not  that  they  needed  it.

After  The  Stone  Roses was released in May of 1989, it climbed as high as #19  on the UK charts, and peaked in the US on Billboard's top 200 at #86.2 Although it wasn't an instant seller on either shore, it did demonstrate a great deal of staying power, lodging itself on the UK charts for forty-eight weeks and the US charts for twenty-six. To date, its sales are estimated to be over four million and in British magazines it consistenty ranks in reader's polls as one of  the best albums of all time.3

There are always varying reasons why some albums just stick around, and in the case of  The Stone Roses, its endless stream of singles certainly didn't hurt. In the UK from July of 1989 to March of 1992, six songs from the album, including ""She Bangs the Drums""  (#34), ""I Am the Resurrection"" (#33), ""Waterfall"" (#27), ""Made of  Stone"" (#20), ""I Wanna Be Adored"" (#20) and ""Elephant  Stone"" (#8), not only made big impressions on  the singles chart, but indicated the enduring power of  the album.4

The band's apotheosis, however, had as much to do with singular events as chart successes. Over the course of  their career they provided celebrated live results, with sold-out shows everywhere from the Hacienda in Manchester to Blackpool's Empress Ballroom to Spike Island in Cheshire, where they played for over 30,000 fans. They burned their bridges in public, splashing paint all over the offices of one former record label, while engaging in a protracted legal bat­ de with another.5 They signed a multimillion dollar deal with Geffen then vanished for several years before even putting out a record.6 They appeared on ''Top of the Pops"" in a performance punctuated  by singer Ian Brown's conspicuously mocking refusal to lip synch. They thumbed  their noses at history, making claims they were going to be bigger than the Beatles, and  that  living legends  Mick Jagger  and  David Bowie were insincere. They turned Jackson Pollock's name into a verb by Polocking their instruments in blasts of color­ful paint. And like Robin Hood, Brown allegedly strolled the streets of Manchester with £100,000 in a carrier bag, giving money to the homeless. Whether you witnessed it firsthand or read about it in the NME, these events forever secured the place of  the Stone Roses right next to all the other immortals in pop music lore.

But before we get to the Stone Roses, it's worth spend­ing a minute or  two on  the rich musical lineage of  their Manchester hometown. Located in northwest England, Manchester is considered the world's first major industrial city and after London is judged by many to be England's unofficial second city. Some of  its early inhabitants  were Flemish weavers specializing in linen and wool, while later, during the Industrial Revolution, the advent of steam- pow­ered engines were crucial in making the city known for being the foremost manufacturers of cotton. However, in spite of its roots in industry, Mancunians have a long tradition of  a fierce commitment to the arts. Boasting notable art galleries, museums, theaters and reputed music institutions, Man­chester's rich cultural heritage has not only been a continu­ous source of  pride for its citizens, its long list of  talented artists, writers and musicians have proven it is more than fer­tile ground for creativity and expression.

When it comes to pop, many believe that Manchester's music infrastructure was properly established in 1978 when television personality Tony Wilson founded  the  now leg­endary Factory Records. Branding every Factory  product with PAC and a corresponding number denoting its place in the Factory sequence, the label cultivated its own visual mythology, which helped create a mystique for its acts. As the label grew so did its roster, which in addition to its flag­ship acts like the Durutti  Column  and Joy Division, also eventually included A Certain Ratio, Cabaret Voltaire, the Railway Children, the Happy Mondays, New Order and for a spell, James, whose brief tenure with Factory was confined to a handful of singles early in their career.
Before  Factory, Manchester  had  the  usual pop  music outlets of  nightclubs and magazines and record stores, but by the end of the seventies, musically, the city found itself to be in a bit of a rut. But when Factory set down its anchor, it ended up performing a kind of musical quadruple bypass and got the blood flowing through the artistic veins of  the city in ways that it never had before.

Capitalizing on his success, Tony Wilson (along with Joy Division  manager Rob  Gretton)  opened  the  Hacienda in 1982, a nightclub that on paper seemed like the perfect base for the bands that were sprouting up all over Manchester. Built in an abandoned yacht showroom, the Hacienda's spar­tan  inner environs and admittedly woeful acoustics at first prevented the club from catching on and instead catered to a small crowd of indie guitar rock devotees. But by the second half of  the eighties, as dance culture took off  and the designer club drug Ecstasy made its way into British youth culture, the Hacienda began to move away from just book­ ing live bands  and began hiring DJs who commandeered their own theme nights, spinning acid house, hip-hop, elec­tro funk and techno. With three levels, enough space to hold almost two thousand  people, and the quavering beats of  a new kind of dance music reverberating throughout, the Hacienda became the hottest nightclub in Manchester.

''The Hacienda was rubbish,"" says former Creation boss and current Poptones head Alan McGee.7''Then they import­ed loads of  Ecstasy and it became good. Suddenly everyone was dancing to balletic house music and it was insane, but it was fantastic fun. The Hacienda was probably the most rock and roll fun you could have outside of Mexico City.""

With a schedule that now included live bands and adven­turous DJs playing various species of  dance music, the Hacienda made it clear that guitar rock and dance music, two previously warring factions, could not only coexist, they could even merge together  without  anyone noticing. The result of this experimental sonic coupling created a new pop offspring and bands like the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses found themselves emerging as the new sound of Britain.

But I'm getting ahead of  myself. No one emerges as the new sound of anything without a lit­tle history of  their own.

Formed  in 1983 by childhood  friends Ian Brown and John Squire, the Stone Roses rose from the quietly smolder­ing ashes of  the  two's first band, a Clash-inspired outflt called the  Patrol. Although  the Stone  Roses recorded  an album that was never released in 1985, in  the nearly flve years it took to fomally put out their debut, they did manage to amass some pretty impressive highlights.8 They opened for Pete Townshend, toured Sweden, played late-night ware­house gigs all over Manchester, had two managers (Howard Jones and Gareth  Evans), recorded a single with producer Martin Hannett (who had produced both the Buzzcocks and Joy Division), were the first band in almost a decade to play a live radio gig for Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, got banned from  the  London  Marquee  nightclub  for  allegedly spraypainting their name in a bold trail across Manchester and they  secured  the  services  of  well-known  producer  John Leckie to take the helm for the recording of  their belated debut album.9Not a bad way for a young band to cram a resume.

But keep in mind that when the Stone Roses went into the studio with Leckie in 1988, musically speaking, they were no longer a young band anymore. People around Man­chester had been aware of  them for years and had perhaps even grown tired of  the band that had been hailed as the next big thing talking so much and producing so little. The lack of an album technically made the Stone Roses rookies, but on the strength of  their years together, they were rookies who were deeply seasoned.

Initially the  rhythm  section  of  the Stone  Roses went through several permutations and at various points included former Patrol singer Andy Couzens, future Colourfield and Fall drummer Simon Wolstencroft, and bassist Pete Garner. But for The Stone Roses album, the band was a solid quartet that consisted of drummer Alan ""Reni"" Wren, bassist Gary ""Mani"" Mounfield, John Squire on guitar and Ian Brown on vocals.

Mani hailed from blue-collar north Manchester, and had cut his musical teeth playing in the Mill with future Inspiral Carpets keyboardist Clint Boon. Wide-eyed and handsome, Mani possessed, according to Jon Stewart, former guitarist of  the Britpop band Sleeper, ""The  kind of  straightforward soulful rootsy ballsy bass playing that drives a band--they wouldn't have been the same without him.""

""He's got every­thing a band needs in those fingers,"" seconds former Woodentops singer Rolo McGinty.

With a kind of  casual toughness,  and a traceable smirk, Reni would lounge  behind  his drum  kit sending out muscu­lar backbeats and improvised  jazz fills, the sticks in his hands flashing like chopper blades. Continually compared to Keith Moon,  Reni is still considered by many  to  have  been  the Stone Roses' secret weapon due to his musical versatility. Wearing his trademark  beanie, he was a dangerously good drummer, but he was also an excellent singer. In his biogra­phy of  the band The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop, John Robb writes of him, ""Not only being content with being a great young drummer on the up, he also possessed an outstanding voice, a voice that would play a key role on the first album, underpinning Brown's husky  fallen-angel mooch."" As for  his importance to  the  band,  Brown  even went so far as tell Uncut: ""...We had a drummer with soul, so we always had a beat. That's  what made the Roses.""

As much  a visual artist as a guitarist, John  Squire's love of  painting seemed  to inform  his musical sensibility. With a dark  fringe  falling halfway over  his eyes, Squire,  an unabashed fan of Jackson  Pollock, followed the artist's lead and  fearlessly let his inventive  riffs whirl and  sinuate  from his instrument in long, helical sparks. With the tendency  in interviews  to say very little, Squire often  described  himself as a loner  and  seemed  to prefer  to let the music speak  for itself The temptation for many journalists was to compare Squire to Johnny  Marr, because not  only were both  from Manchester, but onstage Squire seemed to hold the same silences as Marr, peering up every now and then as his gui­tar veered and chimed.

But Love guitarist Mike Randle is quick to point out the differences between the two: ""Johnny Marr is organic and sweet and  borderless,"" he says. ""Squire's style was brittle, brilliant and melodic. Squire is a very innovative guitarist in that he seems to marry melody and chords quite well togeth­er, which was refreshing for that time. If  you listen to that first record, even when he's not playing notes you still have previous notes in your head.""llAlthough his lean build suggested a kind of pop pugilist, Ian Brown's face hinted at the brains of  an intellectual and the brawn of a bully. He had not quite a villainous sneer, but not exactly one wracked with morality either. With his nar­row, well defined cheekbones, and his thin, gunfighter eyes, Brown could be mistaken for either a cocky graduate stu­dent or a member of  a feral gang who held their meetings under a bridge down by the river. Brown could look some­ times as if he wasn't there at all, but his deep stare also sug­gested a man capable of  a probing focus and a potentially splenetic temperament.
""I  still believe,"" says singer  Martin  Phillips of   New Zealand's beloved indie  rock heroes  the  Chills, ""that  the Stone Roses would not have done anywhere near as well without the powerful charisma and looks of Ian Brown. He looked good from every angle. Though largely expression­less, he looked as if there was a lot more going on inside his mind than there appeared to be once he opened his mouth. His lyrics show him  to be no fool but he did seem deter­ mined to come across as a bit of a lad.""

Although The Stone Roses was only their first album, in interviews the band were as self-possessed and confident as a band with a handful of albums under their belts who had been  through   it  all  before.  Perhaps   their  confidence stemmed from the fact that they knew they had just let loose a soon-to-be classic album on the general public, or maybe they were just brash by nature and didn't know any better. Whatever it was, by 1988 some kind of magic had happened that transformed a band with only a few half-decent singles to their name into a cocksure foursome who were absolute­ly convinced they had recorded one of the best albums ever.

And they weren't shy about saying as much.

John Robb tells me the band's shameless belief in them­selves and their music wasn't something that happened overnight, as it appeared, but that it had developed over the years they had already spent together. Robb also thinks wait­ ing so long to put out their debut actually worked in their favor. ""Luckily for them,"" he says, ""the planned debut album was scuppered; they managed to avoid the first album fum­blings and move straight into top gear. They had time to lis­ten to more music, rehearse even harder and assimilate more influences. By the  time  they  came  to  record  the  lemon album they were brilliant musicians with a very wide musical vocabulary on  the cusp of  a scene that they helped instigate.""

And like Muhammad Ali who said, ""It's hard to be hum­ble, when you're as great as I am"" (it's no wonder that Brown once declared ""boxers are my heroes""), or John  McEnroe who, mid-match, told his opponents  they had no business being on the same court with him, the Stone Roses by the end of the eighties knew they were better than great and the evidence of this knowledge came in interviews and hustings where, in bursts of hubris and swagger, they were quick-wit­ ted, subversively monosyllabic, confrontational  and utterly charming. Always a fanfaron, Brown told Roy Wilkinson of Sounds in 1989 that the Stone Roses' debut was better than the Rolling Stones'  first offering; he told NME  the same year that, ""None  of  our obvious  contemporaries  do any­ thing for  me,"" and  he boasted  the  next month  to  NME again that, ''We're the most important  group in the world because we've got the best songs and we haven't even begun to show our potential yet.""

History shows us that Brown may have been right on the first two of  his points but as for the last one, he was dead wrong. The Stone Roses shows more than a band with poten­tial--it shows  a  band  sizzling with  skill, consumed  with drive and aspiration and possessing an almost preternatural mastery of  the pop paradigm. On  their debut album, they were, for all practical purposes, a band at the height of their powers.

The trouble is, they were not only at the height of  their powers, they were using them all up.

Evidence of this comes five years later on the soggy follow-up Second Coming, which, the band's legal and personal troubles aside, wasn't worthy of their name and didn't live up to its title-instead bringing the band back to earth with the weight of bad reviews, dis­appointing sales and the command over their audience clear­ly dimming. So in spite of  the fearlessness and brilliance of The Stone Roses, it may be that the band, together nearly four years at the time of the recording of their seminal debut, by 1994 had already peaked and simply had little left.

Before we get things started, I should tell you I'm from a small San Francisco suburb called Concord, which is roughly five thousand miles from Manchester. When The Stone Roses came out in the US in 1989, I was a sophomore in college and working as the Music Director of my campus radio station. When I put on the album for the first time and read the accompanying press kit RCA had sent me, which was loaded  with  tasty interviews  from  Melody  Maker and NME, I was immediately hooked. The music was catchy and infectious, but the things the band said in those interviews blew my mind as much as the songs. Cavalier, blunt and mouthy, the Stone Roses were the cockiest musicians I had ever encountered, sure of themselves down to the last word. As for me, I had never been sure of anything in my life and the sheer fearless braggadocio of  the band and their songs was addictive.12 I had always wanted to live the self-assured life and this was the soundtrack I needed.

As much as I loved the album, I'm not ashamed to admit all these years later that at the time, there was a lot about it I didn't understand. I didn't know ""Bye Bye Badman"" was referencing the 1968 Paris student riots; I couldn't make out any of  the lyrics to ""Waterfall""; and  on  ""(Song  for  My) Sugar Spun  Sister"" when Brown sang ""Every  member  of Parliament trips on  glue,'' I thought  he was talking about George Clinton and Bootsy Collins. So at the time, I didn't get exactly what each song was about, but I was in love with the Stone Roses' confidence and certainty of  their place in the world. I had loved a lot of  bands up to that point, like the  Police, R.E.M. and  the  Replacements, but  the  Stone Roses were the first band that I studied and mimicked. I wore the baggiest clothes I could find, started speaking in an English accent and tried to grow a fringe like John Squire-­ but unfortunately being a scrappy Jewish kid with curly hair, all it would do was rise in a frontal puff above my forehead. It was only a fringe (albeit somewhat of  a kinky one) for four minutes after a shower, and then it became the floating curly brownie that was fast becoming my trademark around campus.

I even wrote a glowing review of The Stone Roses for the campus newspaper, and at 2,537 words not only did it chal­lenge the normally enforced 200-word length of the paper's record review guidelines, it was also a complete mess. The only bit worth  saving was, ""Bookended  by 'I  Wanna Be Adored' and 'I Am the Resurrection,' The Stone Roses begins with a plea and ends with a promise.""13

Although  when  it  comes  to  describing  my  favorite albums, I've been known to lapse into a kind of room-clear­ing adorational hyperbole, enough time has passed since I first heard The Stone Roses for my bias to give way to the kind of reason and critical perspective which the passing of years generously affords. But those years have changed nothing, and time has proven rather impotent  at chipping away my love for this album.

I'll be honest, I don't know what Ian Brown's favorite movie is and I have no idea where John Squire likes to buy his clothes, but you have to understand this: I love The Stone Roses and play it more than any other album I own. Not only that,  but  I  can  still do  a dead-on  impersonation  of  Ian Brown; at the university where I teach I have the same Stone Roses poster hanging in my office that I had in my dorm eighteen years ago; and I have lost girlfriends on long drives who have begged me after the eighth listen in a row, to put on something else.
No way. Never. The Stone Roses is my favorite album of all time. And we are gathered here today to talk about it.Notes1 I'm still waiting for a party where a beautiful girl asks me the name of the drummer  on  the  Jazz  Butcher Conspiracy's  Distressed Gentlefolk.  I've rehearsed this so much that I'm  sure if  it ever happens  I'll blow it and instead say the name of the guy who played keyboards in Curiosity Killed the Cat.

2  A two-disc ten-year anniversary edition  of  The Stone Roses, released in 1999, charted at #9 in the UK

3 In 2003 the writers of NME  declared The Stone Roses to be the best album of all time, while in 2004 the British newspaper The Observer revealed a poll of  100 musicians and critics had voted The Stone  Roses as the best British album of all time.

4 Although ""Fools Gold"" (#8) matched ""Elephant Stone"" in terms of chart position,  the Roses' highest charting singles were ""One Love"" (#4)  and ""Love Spreads"" (#2).

5 The paint throwing, by the way, did get the entire band arrested.

6 It's been said that had the Stone Roses fulfilled this contract it would have been worth an estimated $20 million.

7 McGee got his start as the manager of  the Jesus and Mary Chain and is also credited for being the guy who signed Oasis.

8 You can pick through its bones on the bootleg compilation Garage Flower. But if you're an intrepid collector you could try to get your hands on ...And on the Sixth Day Whilst God Created Manchester, the Lord Created the Stone Roses, a highly sought after bootleg album, similar to Garage Flower, which is comprised of  early work from 1985-87, and the Martin Hannet-produced sessions they later shelved.

9 Leckie at that point was best known for his tape-op work on solo albums by John  Lennon, George  Harrison and Paul McCartney, engineering Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and his production on XTC's White Music and the Fall's This Nation Saving Grace.

10 ""I  have rehearsed in a room next to him,"" Stewart recalls, ""and  he was unbelievably loud.""

11 Although from a historical perspective Squire's chiming swoon might be as memorable as Marr's moody jangle, Randle points out that a major dif­ference between the two guitarists is, ''Johnny Marr's canvas has way more colors.""

12  Earlier that year a girl I had a crush on came to my dorm  room late one night, took off  her shirt and crawled into my bed. I remember  thinking, I wonder if she likes me.

13 Conversely, the low point of  the article was, ""Seriously, gang, this is the raddest album of the year!""4Embed"

Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
See Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also like[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

[Verse 1]
I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here?
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People staring at me while I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I

I was scared to reach for it all
Knowing I was herе for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So whеre do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass is greener than it is

[Chorus]
'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh

Oh, I'd fly away, woah, woah, oh (Fly away, fly away)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila, Dinah]
Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind
But without you, boy, I'd be bored all the time
No, I don't really care for the same conversation
Got everythin' I need and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love with a monster
(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies

You looking at the king of the jungle now

Bro sier null, bausj lukka alle saker
Shoutout til min bro, han har vært der siden dag 1
Din bitch hun er average, min bitch hun er så pen
10 på en klokke, men jeg vet ikke tiden
Hun rocker Dolce and Gabbana
Jeg rocker Fendi designer
Hun kom i drømmen, Havana
Shoutout til Geedo my brudda
Jeg drømmer bare om para
Vi hustler natter og daga
Hun ga meg head, kutta plata
Jeg sa: ""gå hjem"", tok en natta
Ay, min bro han er aktiv
Awded gjorde K
Free my bro from the habsi
Fattern kjørte taxi, nå pull up i en taxi
Min bitch hun er classy
Din bitch hun er average
Men forreal tho
Hakke tid yo
På no beats spytter heat av min strid yo
Enderim terapi mon ami c'est la vie
Bruker tid på de rim med no streetflow
Oh shit chiller on the lowkey
Ducker from the police
Stacker p's
Bitchen vil ha gold piece
In peace
Puffer på no street kief
Money chase på disse beats
Går freeze
Min is antarktis
Zoom på no slay cake
Soon hitte boom
In the booth med han Aj
Vroom off to vacay
Smooth det går smooth in the room med hun fayfay
Ooh panties droppa
Sloppy Choppa jeg bare kk
Vi mekker tracks på tracks
Vi tracker stacker på de racks
Jeg stater no cap i en Fendi caps snapback
Som en throwback, chicas kaster slow back, all back
Flasher i den senga får en blowed back ay
Hun vil ha meg, men jeg vil ha en annen
Joint i min munn, husker null fra den dagen
Zigg også zagg og det var ikke planen
Om plan K går galt, vi har alltid en plan B
Vil du test it? Kom og test it
Du kan test it, ta med dine besties
Hun ville facetime, call up on my cellie
Gjorde en crime, men de trodde jeg var hedi

Píčo já jsem theo, píče prolezu píčou
Úplný hovado píčo, když se nakláním nad mísou
Kluci to občas rýsnou, dej flašku chytím beast mode
Ta štětka mě chce sníst, kurvo Sputnik se jde zpíct wow

Nikdy se nestalo, že by nebyl čas to ubalit
Často je čas na to abych si vyhulil držku
Vymrdaná píčo z hoven, text je plnej vulgarit
Tvojí tlustou holku nechci prcat ani trošku, (vůbec)
Vážim to tak moc, že se na ruce dělá mozol
Pozdě v noci doma schytám granáty kozou
A hlídám si svůj trapshit skoro jako kdybych měl dozor
Není potřeba nic zlepšit, trap je tvrdej jako trezor

There was once in Baghdad a man of consequence and rich in monies and immoveables, who was one of the chiefs of the merchants; and Allah had largely endowed him with worldly goods, but had not vouchsafed him what he longed for of offspring; and there passed over him a long space of time, without his being blessed with issue, male or female. His years waxed great; his bones became wasted and his back bent; weakness and weariness grew upon him, and he feared the loss of his wealth and possessions, seeing he had no child whom he might make his heir and by whom his name should be remembered. So he betook himself with supplication to Almighty Allah, fasting by day and praying through the night. Moreover, he vowed many vows to the Living, the Eternal; and visited the pious and was constant in supplication to the Most Highest, till He gave ear to him and accepted his prayer and took pity on his straining and complaining; so that, before many days were past, he knew carnally one of his women and she conceived by him the same night. In due time she finished her months and, casting her burden, bore a male child as he were a slice of the moon; whereupon the merchant fulfilled his vows in his gratitude to Allah, (to whom be honour and glory!) and gave alms and clothed the widow and the orphan. On the seventh night after the boy's birth, he named him Abu al-Husn,[FN#282] and the wet-nurses suckled him and the dry-nurses dandled him and the servants and the slaves carried him and handled him, till he shot up and grew tall and throve greatly and learnt the Sublime Koran and the ordinances of Al-Islam and the Canons of the True Faith; and calligraphy and poetry and mathematics and archery. On this wise he became the union-pearl of his age and the goodliest of the folk of his time and his day; fair of face and of tongue fluent, carrying himself with a light and graceful gait and glorying in his stature proportionate and amorous graces which were to many a bait: and his cheeks were red and flower-white was his forehead and his side face waxed brown with tender down, even as saith one, describing him,

""The spring of the down on cheeks right clearly shows: * And how
       &nbsp     when the Spring is gone shall last the rose?
Dost thou not see that the growth upon his cheek * Is violet-
       &nbsp     bloom that from its leaves outgrows.""

He abode awhile in ease and happiness with his father, who rejoiced and delighted in him, till he came to man's estate, when the merchant one day made him sit down before him and said, ""O my son, the appointed term draweth near; my hour of death is at hand and it remaineth but to meet Allah (to whom belong Majesty and Might!). I leave thee what shall suffice thee, even to thy son's son, of monies and mansions, farms and gardens; wherefore, fear thou Almighty Allah, O my son, in dealing with that which I bequeath to thee and follow none but those who will help thee to the Divine favour."" Not long after, he sickened and died; so his son ordered his funeral,[FN#283] after the goodliest wise, and burying him, returned to his house and sat mourning for him many days and nights. But behold, certain of his friends came in to him and said to him, ""Whoso leaveth a son like thee is not dead; indeed, what is past is past and fled and mourning beseemeth none but the young maid and the wife cloistered."" And they ceased not from him till they wrought on him to enter the Hammam and break off his mourning.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Abu al-Husn was visited by his friends and taken to the Hamman and persuaded to break off his mourning, he presently forgot his father's charge, and his head was turned by his riches; he thought fortune would always wone with him as it was, and that wealth would ever wax and never wane. So he ate and drank and made merry and took his pleasure and gave gifts of gear and coin and was profuse with gold and addrest himself up to eating fowls and breaking the seals of wine-flasks and listening to the giggle of the daughter of the vine, as she gurgled from the flagon and enjoying the jingle of the singing-girls; nor did he give over this way of life, till his wealth was wasted and the case worsened and all his goods went from him and he bit his hands[FN#284] in bitter penitence. For of a truth he had nothing left, after that which he had squandered, but a concubine, a slave-girl whom his father had bequeathed to him with the rest of his estate: and she had no equal in beauty and loveliness and brightness and liveliness and symmetric stature and perfect grace. She was past mistress in every manner of arts and accomplishments and endowed with many excellences, surpassing all the folk of her age and time. She was grown more notorious than a way-mark,[FN#285] for her seductive genius, and outdid the fair both in theory and practice, and she was noted for her swimming gait, flexile and delicate, albeit she was full five feet in height and by all the boons of fortune deckt and dight, with strait arched brows twain, as they were the crescent moon of Sha'abán,[FN#286] and eyes like gazelles' eyne; and nose like the edge of scymitar fine and cheeks like anemones of blood-red shine; and mouth like Solomon's seal and sign and teeth like necklaces of pearls in line; and navel holding an ounce of oil of benzoin and waist more slender than his body whom love hath wasted and whom concealment hath made sick with pine and hind parts heavier than two hills of sand; briefly she was a volume of charms after his saying who saith,

""Her fair shape ravisheth, if face to face she did appear, * And
       &nbsp     if she turn, for severance from her she slayeth sheer.
Sun-like, full-moon-like, sapling-like, unto her character *
       &nbsp    Estrangement no wise appertains nor cruelty austere.
Under the bosom of her shift the garths of Eden are * And the
       &nbsp     full-moon revolveth still upon her neck-rings'
       &nbsp     sphere.""[FN#287]

She seemed a full moon rising and a gazelle browsing, a girl of nine plus five[FN#288] shaming the moon and sun, even as saith of her the sayer eloquent and ingenious,

""Semblance of full-moon Heaven bore, * When five and five are
       &nbsp     conjoined by four;
'Tis not my sin if she made of me * Its like when it riseth
       &nbsp    horizon o'er.""[FN#289]
Clean of skin, odoriferous of breath, it seemed as if she were of fire fashioned and of crystal moulded; rose-red was the cheek of her and perfect the shape and form of her; even as one saith of her, describing her,

""Scented with sandal[FN#290] and musk, right proudly doth she go,
       &nbsp     * With gold and silver and rose and saffron-colour aglow.
A flower in a garden she is, a pearl in an ouch of gold * Or an
       &nbsp    image in chapel[FN#291] set for worship of high and low.
Slender and shapely she is; vivacity bids her arise, * But the
       &nbsp     weight of her hips says, 'Sit, or softly and slowly go.'
Whenas her favours I seek and sue for my heart's desire, * 'Be
       &nbsp     gracious,' her beauty says; but her coquetry answers, 'No.'
Glory to Him who made beauty her portion, and that * Of her lover
       &nbsp     to be the prate of the censurers, heigho!""[FN#292]

She captivated all who saw her, with the excellence of her beauty and the sweetness of her smile,[FN#293] and shot them down with the shafts she launched from her eyes; and withal she was eloquent of speech and excellently skilled in verse. Now when Abu al-Husn had squandered all his gold, and his ill-plight all could behold, and there remained to him naught save this slave-girl, he abode three days without tasting meat or taking rest in sleep, and the handmaid said to him, ""O my lord, carry me to the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the slave-girl to her master, ""O my lord, carry me to Harun al-Rashid, fifth of the sons of Abbas, and seek of him to my price ten thousand dinars. If he deem me dear, say to him: 'O Prince of True Believers, my handmaid is worth more than this: do but prove her, and her value will be magnified in thine eyes; for this slave-girl hath not her equal, and she were unfit to any but thou.'"" And she added, ""Beware, O my lord, of selling me at less than the sum I have named; indeed 'tis but little for the like of me."" Now her owner knew not her worth nor that she had no equal in her day; but he carried her to the Caliph and set her in the presence and repeated what she had bidden him say. The Caliph asked her, ""What is thy name?""; to which she answered, ""My name is Tawaddud.""[FN#294] He then enquired, ""O Tawaddud, in what branches of knowledge dost thou excel?""; and she replied, ""O my lord, I am versed in syntax and poetry and jurisprudence and exegesis and philosophy; and I am skilled in music and the knowledge of the Divine ordinances and in arithmetic and geodesy and geometry and the fables of the ancients. I know the Sublime Koran by heart and have read it according to the seven, the ten and the fourteen modes. I know the number of its chapters and versets and sections and words; and its halves and fourths and eighths and tenths; the number of prostrations which occur in it and the sum total of its letters; and I know what there is in it of abrogating and abrogated[FN#295]; also what parts of it were revealed at Al-Medinah and what at Meccah and the cause of the different revelations. I know the Holy Traditions of the Apostle's sayings, historical and legendary, the established and those whose ascription is doubtful; and I have studied the exact sciences, geometry and philosophy and medicine and logic and rhetoric and composition; and I have learnt many things by rote and am passionately fond of poetry. I can play the lute and know its gamut and notes and notation and the crescendo and diminuendo. If I sing and dance, I seduce, and if I dress and scent myself, I slay. In fine, I have reached a pitch of perfection such as can be estimated only by those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge.""[FN#296] Now when the Caliph heard these words spoken by one so young, he wondered at her eloquence, and turning to Abu al-Husn, said, ""I will summon those who shall discuss with her all she claimeth to know; if she answer correctly, I will give thee the price thou askest for her and more; and if not, thou art fitter to have her than I."" ""With gladness and goodly gree, O Commander of the Faithful,"" replied Abu al-Husn. So the Caliph wrote to the Viceroy of Bassorah, to send him Ibrahim bin Siyyár the prosodist, who was the first man of his day in argument and eloquence and poetry and logic, and bade him bring with him readers of the Koran and learned doctors of the law and physicians and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and philosophers; and Ibrahim was more learned than all. In a little while they arrived at the palace of the Caliphate, knowing not what was to do, and the Caliph sent for them to his sitting-chamber and ordered them to be seated. So they sat down and he bade bring the damsel Tawaddud who came and unveiling, showed herself, as she were a sparkling star.[FN#297] The Caliph set her a stool of gold; and she saluted, and speaking with an eloquent tongue, said, ""O Commander of the Faithful, bid the Olema and the doctors of law and leaches and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and all here present contend with me in argument."" So he said to them, ""I desire of you that ye dispute with this damsel on the things of her faith, and stultify her argument in all she advanceth;"" and they answered, saying, ""We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O Commander of the Faithful."" Upon this Tawaddud bowed her head and said, ""Which of you is the doctor of the law, the scholar, versed in the readings of the Koran and in the Traditions?"" Quoth one of them, ""I am the man thou seekest."" Quoth she, ""Then ask me of what thou wilt."" Said the doctor, ""Hast thou read the precious book of Allah and dost thou know its cancelling and cancelled parts and hast thou meditated its versets and its letters?"" ""Yes,"" answered she. ""Then,"" said he, ""I will proceed to question thee of the obligations and the immutable ordinances: so tell me of these, O damsel, and who is thy Lord, who thy prophet, who thy Guide, what is thy point of fronting in prayer, and who be thy brethren? Also what thy spiritual path and what thy highway?"" Whereto she replied, ""Allah is my Lord, and Mohammed (whom Allah save and assain!) my prophet, and the Koran is my guide and the Ka'abah my fronting; and the True-believers are my brethren. The practice of good is my path and the Sunnah my highway."" The Caliph again marvelled at her words so eloquently spoken by one so young; and the doctor pursued, ""O damsel, with what do we know Almighty Allah?"" Said she, ""With the understanding."" Said he, ""And what is the understanding?"" Quoth she, ""It is of two kinds, natural and acquired.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel continued, ""The understanding is of two kinds, natural and acquired. The natural is that which Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) created for the right direction of His servants after His will; and the acquired is that which men accomplish by dint of study and fair knowledge."" He rejoined, ""Thou hast answered well."" Q ""Where is the seat of the understanding?""—""Allah casteth it in the heart whence its lustrous beams ascend to the brain and there become fixed."" Q ""How knowest thou the Prophet of Allah?"" ""By the reading of Allah's Holy Book and by signs and proofs and portents and miracles!"" Q ""What are the obligations and the immutable ordinances?"" ""The obligations are five. (1) Testification that there is no iláh[FN#298] but Allah, no god but the God alone and One, which for partner hath none, and that Mohammed is His servant and His apostle. (2) The standing in prayers.[FN#299] (3) The payment of the poor-rate. (4) Fasting Ramazan. (5) The Pilgrimage to Allah's Holy House for all to whom the journey is possible. The immutable ordinances are four; to wit, night and day and sun and moon, the which build up life and hope; nor any son of Adam wotteth if they will be destroyed on the Day of Judgment."" Q ""What are the obligatory observances of the Faith?"" ""They are five, prayer, almsgiving, fasting, pilgrimage, fighting for the Faith and abstinence from the forbidden."" Q ""Why dost thou stand up to pray?"" ""To express the devout intent of the slave acknowledging the Deity."" Q ""What are the obligatory conditions which precede standing in prayer?"" ""Purification, covering the shame, avoidance of soiled clothes, standing on a clean place, fronting the Ka'abah, an upright posture, the intent[FN#300] and the pronouncing 'Allaho Akbar' of prohibition.""[FN#301] Q ""With what shouldest thou go forth from thy house to pray?"" ""With the intent of worship mentally pronounced."" Q ""With what intent shouldest thou enter the mosque?"" ""With an intent of service."" Q ""Why do we front the Kiblah[FN#302]?"" ""In obedience to three Divine orders and one Traditional ordinance."" Q ""What are the beginning, the consecration and the end of prayer?"" ""Purification beginneth prayer, saying the Allaho Akbar of prohibition consecrateth, and the salutation endeth prayer."" Q ""What deserveth he who neglecteth prayer?"" ""It is reported, among the authentic Traditions of the Prophet, that he said, 'Whoso neglecteth prayer wilfully and purposely hath no part in Al-Islam.'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fortieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the damsel had repeated the words of that Holy Tradition the doctor cried, ""Thou hast replied aright: now say me, what is prayer?"" ""Prayer is communion between the slave and his lord, and in it are ten virtues: (1) it illumineth the heart; (2) it maketh the face shine; (3) it pleaseth the Compassionate One; (4) it angereth Satan; (5) it conjureth calamity; (6) it wardeth off the mischief of enemies; (7) it multiplieth mercy; (8) it forfendeth vengeance and punishment; (9) it bringeth the slave nigh unto his lord; and (10) it restraineth from lewdness and frowardness. Hence it is one of the absolute requisites and obligatory ordinances and the pillar of the Faith."" Q ""What is the key of prayer?"" ""Wuzd or the lesser ablution.""[FN#303] Q ""What is the key to the lesser ablution?"" ""Intention and naming the Almighty."" Q ""What is the key of naming the Almighty?"" ""Assured faith."" Q ""What is the key of faith?"" ""Trust in the Lord."" Q ""What is the key of trust in the Lord?"" ""Hope."" Q ""What is the key of hope?"" ""Obedience."" Q ""What is the key of obedience?"" ""The confession of the Unity and the acknowledgment of the divinity of Allah."" Q ""What are the Divine ordinances of Wuzu, the minor ablution?"" ""They are six, according to the canon of the Imam al-Sháfi'í Mohammed bin Idris (of whom Allah accept!): (1) intent while washing the face; (2) washing the face; (3) washing the hands and forearms; (4) wiping part of the head; (5) washing the feet and heels; and (6) observing due order.[FN#304] And the traditional statutes are ten: (1) nomination; (2) and washing the hands before putting them into the water-pot; (3) and mouth-rinsing; (4) and snuffing;[FN#305] (5) and wiping the whole head; (6) and wetting the ears within and without with fresh water; (7) and separating a thick beard; (8) and separating the fingers and toes;[FN#306] (9) and washing the right foot before the left and (10) doing each of these thrice and all in unbroken order. When the minor ablution is ended, the worshipper should say, I testify that there is no god but the God, the One, which for partner hath none, and I testify that Mohammed is His servant and His apostle. O my Allah, make me of those who repent and in purity are permanent! Glory to Thee, O my God, and in Thy praise I bear witness, that there is no god save Thou! I crave pardon of Thee and I repent to Thee! For it is reported, in the Holy Traditions, that the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) said of this prayer, 'Whoso endeth every ablution with this prayer, the eight gates of Paradise are open to him; he shall enter at which he pleaseth.'"" Q ""When a man purposeth ablution, what betideth him from the angels and the devils?"" ""When a man prepareth for ablution, the angels come and stand on his right and the devils on his left hand.[FN#307] If he name Almighty Allah at the beginning of the ablution, the devils flee from him and the angels hover over him with a pavilion of light, having four ropes, to each an angel glorifying Allah and craving pardon for him, so long as he remaineth silent or calleth upon the name of Allah. But if he omit to begin washing with naming Allah (to whom belong might and majesty!), neither remain silent, the devils take command of him; and the angels depart from him and Satan whispereth evil thoughts unto him, till he fall into doubt and come short in his ablution. For (quoth he on whom be blessing and peace!), 'A perfect ablution driveth away Satan and assureth against the tyranny of the Sultan'; and again quoth he, 'If calamity befal one who is not pure by ablution; verily and assuredly let him blame none but himself.'"" Q ""What should a man do when he awaketh from sleep?"" ""He should wash his hands thrice, before putting them into the water vessel."" Q ""What are the Koranic and traditional orders anent Ghusl, the complete ablution[FN#308]?"" ""The divine ordinances are intent and 'crowning'[FN#309] the whole body with water, that is, the liquid shall come at every part of the hair and skin. Now the traditional ordinances are the minor ablution as preliminary; rubbing the body; separating the hair and deferring in words[FN#310] the washing of the feet till the end of the ablution.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had recounted to the doctor what were the divine and traditional orders anent Ghusl or total ablution, quoth he, ""Thou hast replied aright: now tell me what are the occasions for Tayammum, or making the ablution with sand and dust; and what are the ordinances thereof, divine and human?"" ""The reasons are seven, viz.: want of water; fear lest water lack; need thereto; going astray on a march; sickness; having broken bones in splints and having open wounds.[FN#311] As for its ordinances, the divine number four, viz., intent, dust, clapping it to the face and clapping it upon the hands; and the human number two, nomination and preferring the right before the left hand."" Q ""What are the conditions, the pillars or essentials, and the traditional statutes of prayer?"" ""The conditions are five: (1) purification of the members; (2) covering of the privy parts; (3) observing the proper hours, either of certainty or to the best of one's belief; (4) fronting the Kiblah; and (5) standing on a clean place. The pillars or essentials number twelve: (1) intent; (2) the Takbír or magnification of prohibition; (3) standing when able to stand[FN#312]; (4) repeating the Fatihah or opening chapter of the Koran and saying, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!' with a verse thereof according to the canon of the Imam Al-Shafi'i; (5) bowing the body and keeping it bowed; (6) returning to the upright posture and so remaining for the time requisite; (7) prostration and permanence therein; (8) sitting between two prostrations and permanence therein; (9) repeating the latter profession of the Faith and sitting up therefor; (10) invoking benediction on the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) (11) the first Salutation,[FN#313] and (12) the intent of making an end of prayer expressed in words. But the traditional statutes are the call to prayer; the standing posture; raising the hands (to either side of the face) whilst pronouncing the prohibition; uttering the magnification before reciting the Fatihah; seeking refuge with Allah[FN#314]; saying, 'Amen'; repeating the chapter of the Koran after the Fatihah, repeating the magnifications during change of posture; saying, 'May Allah hear him who praiseth Him! and O our Lord, to Thee be the praise!'; praying aloud in the proper place[FN#315] and praying under the breath prayers so prescribed; the first profession of unity and sitting up thereto; blessing the Prophet therein; blessing his family in the latter profession and the second Salutation."" Q ""On what is the Zakát or obligatory poor-rate taxable?"" ""On gold and silver and camels and oxen and sheep and wheat and barley and holcus and millet and beans and vetches and rice and raisins and dates."" Q ""What is the Zakát or poor-rate on gold?"" ""Below twenty miskals or dinars, nothing; but on that amount half a dinar for every score and so on proportionally.[FN#316]"" Q ""On silver?"" ""Under two hundred dirhams nothing, then five dirhams on every two hundred and so forth."" Q ""On camels?"" ""For every five, an ewe, or for every twenty-five a pregnant camel."" Q ""On sheep?"" ""An ewe for every forty head,"" Q ""What are the ordinances of the Ramazan Fast?"" ""The Koranic are intent; abstinence from eating, drinking and carnal copulation, and the stoppage of vomiting. It is incumbent on all who submit to the Law, save women in their courses and forty days after childbirth; and it becomes obligatory on sight of the new moon or on news of its appearance, brought by a trustworthy person and commending itself as truth to the hearer's heart; and among its requisites is that the intent be pronounced at nightfall. The traditional ordinances of fasting are, hastening to break the fast at sundown; deferring the fore-dawn meal,[FN#317] and abstaining from speech, save for good works and for calling on the name of Allah and reciting the Koran."" Q ""What things vitiate not the fast?"" ""The use of unguents and eye-powders and the dust of the road and the undesigned swallowing of saliva and the emission of seed in nocturnal pollution or at the sight of a strange woman and blooding and cupping; none of these things vitiates the fast."" Q ""What are the prayers of the two great annual Festivals?"" ""Two one-bow prayers, which be a traditional ordinance, without call to prayer or standing up to pronounce the call;[FN#318] but let the Moslem say, 'Prayer is a collector of all folk!'[FN#319] and pronounce 'Allaho Akbar' seven times in the first prayer, besides the Takbir of prohibition; and, in the second, five times, besides the magnification of rising up (according to the doctrine of the Imam Al-Shafi'i, on whom Allah have mercy!) and make the profession of the Faith.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had answered the doctor anent the Festival-prayers, quoth he, ""Thou hast replied aright: now tell me what are the prayers prescribed on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun or moon?"" ""Two one-bow prayers without call to prayer or standing thereto by the worshipper, who shall make in each two-bow prayer double standing up and double inclinations and two-fold prostrations, then sit and testify and salute."" Q ""What is the ritual of prayer for rain?"" ""Two one-bow prayers without call to prayer or standing thereto; then shall the Moslem make the profession and salute. Moreover the Imam shall deliver an exhortation and ask pardon of Allah, in place of the magnification, as in the two sermons of the Festivals and turn his mantle upper edge downwards and pray and supplicate."" Q ""What are the Witr, the additional or occasional prayers?"" ""The least is a one-bow prayer and the most eleven."" Q ""What is the forenoon prayer?"" ""At least, two one-bow prayers and at most, twelve."" Q ""What hast thou to say of the I'itikáf or retreat[FN#320]?"" ""It is a matter of traditional ordinance."" Q ""What are its conditions?"" ""(1) intent; (2) not leaving the mosque save of necessity; (3) not having to do with a woman; (4) fasting; and (5) abstaining from speech."" Q ""Under what conditions is the Hajj or Pilgrimage[FN#321] obligatory?"" ""Manhood, and understanding and being a Moslem and practicability; in which case it is obligatory on all, once before death."" Q ""What are the Koranic statutes of the Pilgrimage?"" ""(1) The Ihrám or pilgrim's habit; (2) the standing at Arafat; (3) circumambulating the Ka'abah; (4) running between Safá and Marwah[FN#322]; and (5) shaving or clipping the hair."" Q ""What are the Koranic statutes of the 'Umrah[FN#323] or lesser pilgrimage?"" ""Assuming the pilgrim's habit and compassing and running."" Q ""What are the Koranic ordinances of the assumption of the pilgrim's habit?""[FN#324] ""Doffing sewn garments, forswearing perfume and ceasing to shave the head or pare the nails, and avoiding the killing of game, and eschewing carnal copulation."" Q ""What are the traditional statutes of the pilgrimage?"" ""(1) The crying out 'Labbay'ka, Adsum, Here am I, O our Lord, here am I!'[FN#325]4 (2) the Ka'abah-circuitings[FN#326] of arrival and departure; (3) the passing the night at the Mosque of Muzdalifah and in the valley of Mina, and (4) the lapidation.[FN#327]"" Q ""What is the Jihád or Holy War and its essentials?"" ""Its essentials are: (1) the descent of the Infidels upon us; (2) the presence of the Imam; (3) a state of preparation; and (4) firmness in meeting the foe. Its traditional ordinance is incital to battle, in that the Most High hath said, 'O thou my Prophet, incite the faithful to fight!'[FN#328]"" Q ""What are the ordinances of buying and selling?"" ""The Koranic are: (1) offer and acceptance and (2) if the thing sold be a white slave, by whom one profiteth, all possible endeavour to convert him to Al-Islam; and (3) to abstain from usury; the traditional are: making void[FN#329] and option before not after separating, according to his saying (whom Allah bless and preserve!), 'The parties to a sale shall have the option of cancelling or altering terms whilst they are yet unseparated.'"", Q ""What is it forbidden to sell for what?"" ""On this point I mind me of an authentic tradition, reported by Náf'i[FN#330] of the Apostle of Allah, that he forbade the barter of dried dates for fresh and fresh figs for dry and jerked for fresh meat and cream for clarified butter; in fine, all eatables of one and the same kind, it is unlawful to buy or barter some for other some.[FN#331]"" Now when the doctor of law heard her words and knew that she was wit-keen, penetrative, ingenious and learned in jurisprudence and the Traditions and the interpretation of the Koran and what not else, he said in his mind, ""Needs must I manoeuvre with her, that I may overcome her in the assembly of the Commander of the Faithful."" So he said to her, ""O damsel, what is the lexicographical meaning of Wuzu?"" And she answered, ""Philologically it signifieth cleanliness and freedom from impurities."" Q ""And of Salát or prayer?"" ""An invocation of good"" Q ""And of Ghusl?"" ""Purification."" Q ""And of Saum or fasting?"" ""Abstention."" Q ""And of Zakát?"" ""Increase. Q ""And of Hajj or pilgrimage?"" ""Visitation."" Q ""And of Jihád?"" ""Repelling."" With this the doctor's arguments were cut off,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the doctor's arguments were cut off, he rose to his feet and said, ""Bear witness against me, O Commander of the Faithful, that this damsel is more learned in the Law than I am."" Quoth she, ""I will ask thee somewhat, which do thou answer me speedily, an thou be indeed a learned man."" Quoth he, ""Say on;"" and she said, ""What are the arrows of the Faith?"" Answered he, ""They number ten: (1) Testification, that is, religion; (2) Prayer, that is, the covenant; (3) Alms, that is, purification; (4) Fasting, that is, defensive armour; (5) Pilgrimage, that is, the Law; (6) Fighting for the Faith, that is, a general duty; (7) Bidding to beneficence and (8) Forbidding from frowardness, both of which are a man's honour; (9) Commune,[FN#332] that is, sociableness of the Faithful; and (10) Seeking knowledge, that is, the praiseworthy path."" She rejoined, ""Thou hast replied aright and now remaineth but one question, 'What be the roots or fundamentals of Al-Islam?'"" He said ""They are four: sincerity of belief, truth of intent, observance of the lawful limit and keeping the covenant."" Then said she, ""I have one more question to ask thee, which if thou answer, it is well; else, I will take thy clothes."" Quoth he, ""Speak, O damsel;"" and she said, ""What are the branches or superstructure of Al-Islam?"" But he was silent awhile and made no reply: so she cried ""Doff thy clothes and I will expound them to thee."" Quoth the Caliph ""Expound them, and I will make him put off his clothes for thee."" She said, ""There are two-and-twenty branches: (1) holding fast to the Book of Allah the Most Highest; (2) taking example by His Apostle (whom Allah bless and preserve!); (3) abstaining from evil doing; (4) eating what is lawful and (5) avoiding what is unlawful; (6) restitution of things wrongfully taken; (7) repentance; (8) knowledge of the Law; (9) love of the Friend,[FN#333] (10) and of the followers of the true Revelation; (11) belief in the apostles of Al-Islam; (12) fear of apostacy; (13) preparation for departing this life; (14) force of conviction; (15) mercy on all possible occasions; (16) strength in time of weakness; (17) patience under trials; (18) knowledge of Allah Almighty and (19) of what His Prophet hath made known to us; (20) thwarting Iblis the accursed; (21) striving earnestly against the lusts of the soul and warring them down, and (22) devotion to the one God."" Now when the Commander of the Faithful heard her words, he bade the professor put off his clothes and hooded turband; and so did that doctor and went forth, beaten and confounded, from the Caliph's presence. Thereupon another man stood up and said to her, ""O damsel, hear a few questions from me."" Quoth she, ""Say on;' and he asked, ""What are the conditions of purchase by advance?"" whereto she answered, ""That the price be fixed, the kind be fixed and the period of delivery be fixed and known."" Q ""What are the Koranic and the traditional canons of eating?"" ""The confession that Allah Almighty provideth the eater and giveth him meat and drink, with thanksgiving to Him therefor."" Q ""What is thanksgiving?"" ""The use by the creature of that which the Creator vouchsafeth to him, according as it was created for the creature."" Q ""What are the traditional canons of eating?"" ""The Bismillah[FN#334] and washing both hands; sitting on the left of the hind part; eating with three fingers, and eating of that which hath been duly masticated.[FN#335]"" Q ""What are good manners in eating?"" ""Taking small mouthfuls and looking little at one's table-companion.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had answered concerning good manners in eating, the doctor who was trying her, rejoined, ""Thou hast replied aright. Now tell me what are the stays of the heart and their supports?""[FN#336] ""The stays and supports both number three: (1) holding fast to the Faith, the support whereof is the shunning of infidelity; (2) holding fast to the Traditional Law, and its support the shunning of innovation; and (3) holding fast to obedience, and its support the shunning of disobedience."" Q ""What are the conditions of Wuzu?"" ""(1) being a Moslem; (2) discernment of good and evil; (3) purity of the water, and (4) absence of material or religious impediments."" Q ""What is belief?"" ""It is divided into nine parts: (1) belief in the One worshipped; (2) belief in the condition of slavery of the worshipper; (3) belief in the personality of the Deity; (4) belief in the Two Handfuls;[FN#337] (5) belief in Providence which allotteth to man his lot; (6) belief in the Abrogating and (7) in the Abrogated; (8) belief in Allah, His angels and apostles; and (9) in fore-ordained Fate, general and individual, its good and ill, its sweet and bitter."" Q ""What three things do away other three?"" ""It is told of Sufyán al-Saurí[FN#338] that he said, 'Three things do away with other three. Making light of the pious doth away the future life; making light of Kings doth away this life; and, making light of expenditure doth away wealth.'"" Q ""What are the keys of the heavens, and how many gates have they.?"" ""Quoth Almighty Allah, 'And the heaven shall be opened and be full of portals;'[FN#339] and quoth he whom Allah bless and preserve!, 'None knoweth the number of the gates of heavens, save He who created the heavens, and there is no son of Adam but hath two gates allotted to him in the heavens, one whereby his daily bread descendeth and another wherethrough his works ascend. The first gate is not closed, save when his term of life cometh to an end, nor the gate of works, good and evil, till his soul ascend for judgment.'"" Q ""Tell me of a thing and a half thing and a no-thing."" ""The thing is the Moslem; the half thing the hypocrite,[FN#340] and the no-thing the miscreant."" Q ""Tell me of various kinds of hearts."" ""There is the whole heart, the sick heart, the contrite heart, the vowed heart and the enlightened heart. Now the whole heart is that of Abraham, the Friend of Allah; the sick heart is that of the Unbeliever in Al-Islam; the contrite heart is that of the pious who fear the Lord; the vowed heart is that of our Lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!) and the illuminated heart is that of his followers. Furthermore, the hearts of learned Olema are of three kinds, the heart which is in love with this world; the heart which loveth the next world, and the heart which loveth its Lord; and it is said that hearts are three, the suspended, that of the infidel; the non-existent, that of the hypocrite; and the constant, that of the True-believer. Moreover, it is said that the firm heart is of three kinds, viz., the heart dilated with light and faith, the heart wounded with fear of estrangement, and the heart which feareth to be forsaken of its Supreme Friend.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the second doctor declared. ""Thou hast said well,"" quoth she to the Caliph, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he hath questioned me, till he is weary, and now I will ask of him two questions. If he answer them both, it is well; and if not, I will take his clothes and he shall wend in peace."" Quoth the doctor, ""Ask me what thou wilt,"" and she said, ""What sayest thou religion is?"" Answered he, ""Religion is confession of Faith with the tongue and conviction with the heart and correspondent action with the members. He (upon whom be blessings and peace!) hath said, 'The believer is not perfect in belief, except he perfect himself in five qualities, namely: trust in Allah,[FN#341] committal of his affair to Allah, submission to the commands of Allah, acquiescence in the decrees of Allah; and that all he doth be done for sake of Allah; so is he of those who are acceptable to the Deity, and who give to Him and withhold for Him; and such man is perfect in belief.'"" Then said she, ""What is the Divine ordinance of ordinances and the ordinance which is the initiator of all ordinances and that of which all others stand in need and that which comprehendeth all others; and what is the traditional ordinance that entereth into the Koranic, and the prophetic practice whereby the Divine is completed?"" But he was silent and made no reply; whereupon the Caliph bade her expound and ordered him to doff his clothes and give them to her. Said she, ""O doctor, the Koranic ordinance of ordinances is the knowledge of Allah Almighty; that, which is the initiative of all others, is the testifying there is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God; that, of which all others have need, is the Wuzu-ablution; that, which compriseth all others, is the Ghusl-ablution from defilement[FN#342]; the Traditional ordinance that entereth into the Koranic, is the separation of the fingers and the thick beard;[FN#343] and that, wherewith all Koranic ordinances are completed, is circumcision.""[FN#344] Therewith was made manifest the defeat of the doctor, who rose to his feet and said, ""I call Allah to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, that this damsel is more learned than I in theology and what pertaineth to the Law."" So saying, he put off his clothes and went away ignominiously worsted. Then she turned to the rest of the learned men present and said, ""O masters, which of you is the Koranist, the reader and reciter of the Koran, versed in the seven readings and in syntax and in lexicography?"" Thereupon a professor arose and, seating himself before her, said ""Hast thou read the Book of Almighty Allah and made thyself thoroughly acquainted with its signs, that is its verses, and its abrogating parts and abrogated portions, its unequivocal commands and its ambiguous; and the difference of its revelations, Meccan and Medinan? Dost thou understand its interpretation and hast thou studied it, according to the various traditions and origins?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; and he said, ""What then is the number of its chapters, how many are the decades and versets, how many words and how many letters and how many acts of prostration and how many prophets and how many chapters are Medinan and how many are Meccan and how many birds are mentioned in it?"" Replied she, ""O my lord, its chapters are an hundred and fourteen, whereof seventy were revealed at Meccah and forty-four at Al-Medinah; and it containeth six hundred and twenty-one decades; six thousand three hundred and thirty-six versets;[FN#345] seventy-nine thousand four hundred and thirty-nine words and three hundred and twenty-three thousand and six hundred and seventy letters; and to the reader thereof, for every letter, are given ten benefits. The acts of prostration it compriseth are fourteen.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the professor of Koranic exegesis questioned the damsel, she continued, ""As regards the Prophets named in the Book there be five-and-twenty, to wit, Adam, Noah,[FN#346] Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Lot, Elisha, Jonah, Salih,[FN#347] or Heber, Húd,[FN#348] Shua'yb or Jethro,[FN#349] David, Solomon, Zú'l-kafl or Joshua, Idrís, Elias, Yahyá or John the Baptist, Zacharias, Job, Moses, Aaron, Jesus and Mohammed,[FN#350] the peace of Allah and His blessing be on them all! Moreover, nine flying things are mentioned in the Koran, namely, the gnat, the bee, the fly, the ant, the hoopoe, the crow, the locust, the swallow and the bird of Jesus[FN#351] (on whom be peace!), to wit, the bat."" Q ""Which is the most excellent chapter of the Koran?"" ""That of The Cow.[FN#352]"" Q ""Which is the most magnificent verse?"" ""That of the Throne; it hath fifty words, bearing in each fifty blessings."" Q ""What sign or verse hath in it nine signs or wonders?"" ""That in which quoth Allah Almighty, 'Verily, in the creation of the Heaven and the Earth: and in the vicissitude of night, and day; and in the ship which saileth through the sea laden with what is profitable for mankind; and in the rain-water which God sendeth down from Heaven, quickening thereby the dead ground and replenishing the same with all sorts of cattle; and in the change of winds and in the clouds that are compelled to do service between the Heaven and the Earth;[FN#353]—are signs to people of understanding.'"" Q ""Which verse is the most just?"" ""That in which Allah saith, 'Verily, Allah enjoineth justice and the doing of good, and the giving unto kindred what shall be necessary; and He forbiddeth wickedness and iniquity and oppression'""[FN#354] Q ""Which is the most greedy?"" ""That in which quoth Allah, 'Is it that every man of them greedeth to enter the Garden of Delight?'""[FN#355] Q ""Which is the most hopeful?"" ""That in which quoth Almighty Allah, 'Say: O my servants who have transgressed against your own souls, despair not of the mercy of Allah; seeing, that Allah forgiveth all sins; aye Gracious, Merciful is He.'""[FN#356] Q ""By what school of intonation dost thou read?"" ""By that of the people of Paradise, to wit, the version of Náf'i."" Q ""In which verse doth Allah make prophets lie?""[FN#357] ""In that wherein He saith, 'They (the brothers of Joseph) brought his inner garment stained with false blood.'""[FN#358] Q ""In which doth He make unbelievers speak the truth?"" ""In that wherein He saith, 'The Jews say, 'The Christians are grounded on nothing,' and the Christians say, 'The Jews are grounded on nothing'; and yet they both read the Scriptures;'[FN#359] and, so saying, all say sooth."" Q ""In which doth God speak in his own person?"" ""In that in which he saith, 'I have not created Genii and men for any other end than that they should serve me.'""[FN#360] Q ""In which verse do the angels speak?"" ""In that which saith, 'But we celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.'""[FN#361] Q ""What sayest thou of the formula:—I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned?"" ""It is obligatory by commandment of Allah on all before reading the Koran, as appeareth by His saying, 'When thou readest the Koran, seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned.'""[FN#362] Q ""What signify the words 'seeking refuge'[FN#363] and what are the variants of the formula?"" ""Some say, 'I take refuge with Allah the All-hearing and All-knowing,' and others, 'With Allah the Strong;' but the best is that whereof the Sublime Koran speaketh and the Traditions perpetuate. And he (whom Allah bless and keep!) was used to ejaculate, 'I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned.' And quoth a Tradition, reported by Naf'i on the authority of his adopted father, 'The apostle of Allah, was wont when he rose in the night to pray, to say aloud, 'Allaho Akbar'; God is Most Great, with all Majesty! Praise be to Allah abundantly! Glory to Allah morn and even be!' Then would he say, 'I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned and from the delusions of the Devils and their evil suggestions.' And it is told of Ibn Abbas[FN#364] (of whom Allah accept!) that he said, 'The first time Gabriel came down to the Prophet with revelation he taught him the 'seeking refuge,' saying, 'O Mohammed, say, I seek refuge with Allah the All-hearing and All-knowing;' then say, 'In the name of Allah the Compassionating, the Compassionate!' Read, in the name of thy Lord who created;—created man of blood-clots.""[FN#365] Now when the Koranist heard her words he marvelled at her expressions, her eloquence, her learning, her excellence, and said, ""O damsel, what sayst thou of the verse 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate'? Is it one of the verses of the Koran?"" ""Yes; it is a verset of 'The Ant'[FN#366] occurring also at the head of the first and between every two following chapters; and there is much difference of opinion, respecting this, among the learned.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had told the professor concerning the difference of opinion among the learned touching the ""Basmalah,"" he said, ""Thou hast replied aright: now tell me why is not the formula written at the head of the chapter of Immunity[FN#367]?""; and she answered, ""When this chapter was revealed from on high for the dissolution of the alliance between the Prophet and the idolaters, He (whom Allah bless and preserve!) sent Ali[FN#368] ibn Abí Tálib (whose face Allah honour!) therewith, and he read the chapter to them, but did not read the Basmalah.""[FN#369] Q ""What of the excellence of the formula and its blessing?"" ""It is told of the Prophet that he said, 'Never is the Basmalah pronounced over aught, but there is a blessing in it;' and it is reported, on authority of Him (whom Allah bless and preserve!) that the Lord of Glory swore by His glory that never should the Basmalah be pronounced over a sick person, but he should be healed of his sickness. Moreover, it is said that, when Allah created the empyrean, it was agitated with an exceeding agitation; but He wrote on it, 'Bismillah' and its agitation subsided. When the formula first descended from heaven to the Prophet, he said, 'I am safe from three things, earthquake and metamorphosis and drowning; and indeed its boons are great and its blessings too many to enumerate. It is told of Allah's Apostle that he said, 'There will be brought on the Judgment-day a man with whom He shall reckon and finding no good deed to his account, shall order him to the Fire; but the man will cry, 'O my God, Thou hast not dealt justly by me!' Then shall Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) say, 'How so?' and the man shall answer, O Lord, for that Thou callest Thyself the Compassionating, the Compassionate, yet wilt Thou punish me with the Fire!' And Allah (magnified be His Majesty!) shall reply, 'I did indeed name myself the Compassionating, the Compassionate. Carry My servant to Paradise, of My mercy, for I am the most Merciful of the mercifuls!'"" Q ""What was the origin of the use of the Basmalah?"" ""When Allah sent down from Heaven the Koran, they wrote, 'In Thy name, O my God!'; when Allah revealed the words, 'Say: Call upon Allah, or call upon the Compassionating, what days ye pray, for hath He the most excellent names,'[FN#370] they wrote, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate; and, when He revealed the words, 'Your God is one God, there is no God but He, the Compassionating, the Compassionate,'[FN#371] they wrote, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!'"" Now when the Koranist heard her reply, he hung down his head and said to himself, ""This be a marvel of marvels! How hath this slave-girl expounded the origin of the Basmalah? But, by Allah, needs must I go a bout with her and haply defeat her."" So he asked, ""Did Allah reveal the Koran all at once or at times manifold?"" She answered, ""Gabriel the Faithful (on whom be peace!) descended with it from the Lord of the Worlds upon His Prophet Mohammed, Prince of the Apostles and Seal of the Prophets, by detached versets: bidding and forbidding, covenanting and comminating, and containing advices and instances in the course of twenty years as occasion called for it."" Q ""Which chapter was first revealed?"" ""According to Ibn Abbas, that entituled 'Congealed Blood':[FN#372] and, according to Jábir bin Abdillah,[FN#373] that called 'The Covered' which preceded all others.[FN#374]"" Q ""Which verset was the last revealed?"" ""That of 'Usury',[FN#375] and it is also said, the verse, 'When there cometh Allah's succour and victory.'""[FN#376]—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel told the Koranist which was the last verse he said, ""Thou hast replied aright; now tell me the names of the Companions who collected the Koran, in the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah."" And she answered ""They were four, Ubay ibn Ka'ab, Zayd ibn Sábit, Abú Obaydah 'Aamir bin Jarráh, and Othmán bin Affán[FN#377] (Allah accept of them one and all!)"" Q ""Who are the readers, from whom the accepted reading of the Koran is taken?"" ""They number four, Abdallah bin Mas'úd, Ubay bin Ka'ab, Ma'az bin Jabal and Sálim bin Abdillah."" Q ""What sayest thou of the words of the Most High, 'That which is sacrificed to stones'""?[FN#378] ""The stones are idols, which are set up and worshipped, instead of Allah the Most High, and from this we seek refuge with Allah."" Q ""What sayest thou of the words of the Most High 'Thou knowest what is in my soul, and I know not what is in Thy soul'""?[FN#379] ""They mean, 'Thou knowest the truth of me and what is in me, and I know not what is in Thee;' and the proof of this are His words,[FN#380] 'Thou art He who wottest the hidden things'; and it is said, also, 'Thou knowest my essence, but I know not Thine essence.'"" Q ""What sayst thou of the words of the Most High, 'O true believers, forbid not yourselves the good things which Allah hath allowed you?'""[FN#381] ""My Shaykh (on whom Allah have mercy!) told me that the Companion Al-Zahhák related: 'There was a people of the True-believers who said, 'We will dock our members masculine and don sackcloth;' whereupon this verse was revealed. But Al-Kutádah declareth that it was revealed on account of sundry Companions of the Apostle of Allah, namely, Ali ibn Abí Tálib and Othmán bin Musa'ab and others, who said, 'We will geld ourselves and don hair cloth and make us monks.'"" Q ""What sayest thou of the words of the Most Highest, 'And Allah took Abraham for His friend'""?[FN#382] ""The friend of Allah is the needy, the poor, and (according to another saying) he is the lover, he who is detached from the world in the love of Allah Almighty and in whose attachment there is no falling away."" Now when the Koranist[FN#383] saw her pass on in speech with the passage of the clouds and that she stayed not in reply, he rose to his feet and said, ""I take Allah to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, that this damsel is more learned than I in Koranic exegesis and what pertaineth thereto."" Then said she, ""I will ask thee one question, which if thou answer it is well; but if thou answer not, I will strip off thy clothes."" Quoth the Commander of the Faithful, ""Ask on,"" and she enquired, ""Which verset of the Koran hath in it three-and-twenty Káfs, which sixteen Míms, which an hundred and forty 'Ayns[FN#384] and which section[FN#385] lacketh the formula, 'To Whom belong glory and glorification and majesty[FN#386]?'"" The Koranist could not reply, and she said to him, ""Put off thy clothes."" So he doffed them, and she continued, ""O Commander of the Faithful, the verset of the sixteen Mims is in the chapter Húd and is the saying of the Most High, 'It was said, O Noah, go down in peace from us, and blessing upon thee!'[FN#387] that of the three-and-twenty Kafs is the verse called of the Faith, in the chapter of The Cow; that of the hundred and forty Ayns is in the chapter of Al-A'aráf,[FN#388] where the Lord saith, 'And Moses chose seventy men of his tribe to attend our appointed time;[FN#389] to each man a pair of eyes.'[FN#390] And the lesson, which lacketh the formula, 'To Whom be glory and glorification,' is that which comprises the chapters, The Hour draweth nigh and the Moon shall be cloven in twain[FN#391]; The Compassionate and The Event.""[FN#392] Thereupon the professor departed in confusion.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Forty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel defeated the Koranist and took off his clothes and sent him away confused, then came forward the skilled physician and said to her, ""We are free of theology and come now to physiology. Tell me, therefore, how is man made; how many veins, bones and vertebrae are there in his body; which is the first and chief vein and why Adam was named Adam?"" She replied, ""Adam was called Adam, because of his udmah, that is, the wheaten colour of his complexion and also (it is said) because he was created of the adim of the earth, that is to say, of the surface-soil. His breast was made of the earth of the Ka'abah, his head of earth from the East and his legs of earth from the West. There were created for him seven doors in his head, viz., the eyes, the ears, the nostrils and the mouth, and two passages, before and behind. The eyes were made the seat of the sight-sense, the ears the seat of the hearing-sense, the nostrils the seat of the smell-sense, the mouth the seat of the taste-sense and the tongue to utter what is in the heart of man.[FN#393] Now Adam was made of a compound of the four elements, which be water, earth, fire and air. The yellow bile is the humour of fire, being hot-dry; the black bile that of earth, being cold-dry; the phlegm that of water, being cold-moist, and the blood that of air, being hot-moist.[FN#394] There were made in man three hundred and sixty veins, two hundred and forty-nine bones, and three souls[FN#395] or spirits, the animal, the rational and the natural, to each of which is allotted its proper function. Moreover, Allah made him a heart and spleen and lungs and six intestines and a liver and two kidneys and buttocks and brain and bones and skin and five senses; hearing, seeing, smell, taste, touch. The heart He set on the left side of the breast and made the stomach the guide and governor thereof. He appointed the lungs for a fan to the heart and stablished the liver on the right side, opposite thereto. Moreover, He made, besides this, the diaphragm and the viscera and set up the bones of the breast and latticed them with the ribs."" Q ""How many ventricles are there in a man's head?"" ""Three, which contain five faculties, styled the intrinsic senses, to wit, common sense, imagination, the thinking faculty, perception and memory."" Q ""Describe to me the configuration of the bones.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fiftieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the physicist said to her, ""Describe to me the configuration of the bones,"" she replied, ""Man's frame consists of two hundred and forty bones, which are divided into three parts, the head, the trunk and the extremities. The head is divided into calvarium and face. The skull is constructed of eight bones, and to it are attached the four osselets of the ear. The face is furnished with an upper jaw of eleven bones and a lower jaw of one; and to these are added the teeth two-and-thirty in number, and the os hyoides.[FN#396] The trunk is divided into spinal column, breast and basin. The spinal column is made up of four-and-twenty bones, called Fikár or vertebræ; the breast, of the breastbone and the ribs, which are four-and-twenty in number, twelve on each side; and the basin of the hips, the sacrum[FN#397] and os coccygis. The extremities divided into upper and lower, arms and legs. The arms are again divided: firstly into shoulder, comprising shoulder blades and collar bone; secondly into the upper arm which is one bone; thirdly into fore-arm, composed of two bones, the radius and the ulna; and fourthly into the hand, consisting of the wrist, the metacarpus of five and the fingers, which number five, of three bones each, called the phalanges, except the thumb, which hath but two. The lower extremities are divided: firstly into thigh, which is one bone; secondly into leg, composed of three bones, the tibia, the fibula and the patella; and thirdly into the foot, divided, like the hand, into tarsus, metatarsus and toes; and is composed of seven bones, ranged in two rows, two in one and five in the other; and the metatarsus is composed of five bones and the toes number five, each of three phalanges except the big toe which hath only two."" Q ""Which is the root of the veins?"" ""The aorta, from which they ramify, and they are many, none knoweth the tale of them save He who created them; but I repeat, it is said that they number three hundred and sixty.[FN#398] Moreover, Allah hath appointed the tongue as interpreter for the thought, the eyes to serve as lanterns, the nostrils to smell with, and the hands for prehensors. The liver is the seat of pity, the spleen of laughter[FN#399] and the kidneys of craft; the lungs are ventilators, the stomach the store-house, and the heart the prop and pillar of the body. When the heart is sound, the whole body is sound, and when the heart is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt."" Q ""What are the outward signs and symptoms evidencing disease in the members of the body, both external and internal?"" ""A physician, who is a man of understanding, looketh into the state of the body and is guided by the feel of the hands,[FN#400] according as they are firm or flabby, hot or cool, moist or dry. Internal disorders are also indicated by external symptoms, such as yellowness of the white of the eyes, which denoteth jaundice, and bending of the back, which denoteth disease of the lungs."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had described to the doctor the outer signs and symptoms quoth he, ""Thou hast replied aright! now what are the internal symptoms of disease?"" ""The science of the diagnosis of disease by internal symptoms is founded upon six canons: (1) the patient's actions; (2) what is evacuated from his body; (3) the nature of the pain; and (4) the site thereof; (5) swelling; and (6) the effluvia given off his person."" Q ""How cometh hurt to the head?"" ""By the ingestion of food upon food, before the first be digested, and by fullness upon fullness; this it is that wasteth peoples. He who would live long, let him be early with the morning-meal and not late with the evening-meal; let him be sparing of commerce with women and chary of such depletory measures as cupping and blood-letting; and let him make of his belly three parts, one for food, one for drink and the third for air; for that a man's intestines are eighteen spans in length and it befitteth that he appoint six for meat, six for drink, and six for breath. If he walk, let him go gently; it will be wholesomer for him and better for his body and more in accordance with the saying of the Almighty, 'Walk not proudly on the earth.'""[FN#401] Q ""What are the symptoms of yellow bile and what is to be feared therefrom?"" ""The symptoms are sallow complexion and bitter taste in the mouth with dryness; failure of the appetite, venereal and other, and rapid pulse; and the patient hath to fear high fever and delirium and eruptions and jaundice and tumour and ulcers of the bowels and excessive thirst."" Q ""What are the symptoms of black bile and what hath the patient to fear from it, an it get the mastery of the body?"" ""The symptoms are false appetite and great mental disquiet and cark and care; and it behoveth that it be evacuated, else it will generate melancholia[FN#402] and leprosy and cancer and disease of the spleen and ulceration of the bowels."" Q ""Into how many branches is the art of medicine divided?"" ""Into two: the art of diagnosing diseases, and that of restoring the diseased body to health."" Q ""When is the drinking of medicine more efficacious than otherwhen?"" ""When the sap runs in the wood and the grape thickens in the cluster and the two auspicious planets, Jupiter and Venus, are in the ascendant; then setteth in the proper season for drinking of drugs and doing away of disease."" Q ""What time is it, when, if a man drink water from a new vessel, the drink is sweeter and lighter or more digestible to him than at another time, and there ascendeth to him a pleasant fragrance and a penetrating?"" ""When he waiteth awhile after eating, as quoth the poet,

'Drink not upon thy food in haste but wait awhile; * Else thou
       &nbsp     with halter shalt thy frame to sickness lead:
And patient bear a little thirst from food, then drink; * And
       &nbsp     thus, O brother, haply thou shalt win thy need.[FN#403]'""

Q ""What food is it that giveth not rise to ailments?"" ""That which is not eaten but after hunger, and when it is eaten, the ribs are not filled with it, even as saith Jálínús or Galen the physician, 'Whoso will take in food, let him go slowly and he shall not go wrongly.' And to conclude with His saying (on whom be blessing and peace!), 'The stomach is the house of disease, and diet is the head of healing; for the origin of all sickness is indigestion, that is to say, corruption of the meat'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-second Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel said to the doctor, ""'The stomach is the house of disease and diet is the head of healing; for the origin of all sickness is indigestion, that is to say, corruption of the meat in the stomach;'"" he rejoined, ""Thou hast replied aright! what sayest thou of the Hammam?"" ""Let not the full man enter it. Quoth the Prophet, 'The bath is the blessing of the house, for that it cleanseth the body and calleth to mind the Fire.'"" Q ""What Hammams are best for bathing in?"" ""Those whose waters are sweet and whose space is ample and which are kept well aired; their atmosphere representing the four seasons—autumn and summer and winter and spring."" Q ""What kind of food is the most profitable?"" ""That which women make and which hath not cost overmuch trouble and which is readily digested. The most excellent of food is brewis[FN#404] or bread sopped in broth; according to the saying of the Prophet, 'Brewis excelleth other food, even as Ayishah excelleth other women.'"" Q ""What kind of kitchen, or seasoning, is most profitable?"" ""'Flesh meat' (quoth the Prophet) 'is the most excellent of kitchen; for that it is the delight of this world and the next world.'"" Q ""What kind of meat is the most profitable?"" ""Mutton; but jerked meat is to be avoided, for there is no profit in it."" Q ""What of fruits?"" ""Eat them in their prime and quit them when their season is past."" Q ""What sayest thou of drinking water?"" ""Drink it not in large quantities nor swallow it by gulps, or it will give thee head-ache and cause divers kinds of harm; neither drink it immediately after leaving the Hammam nor after carnal copulation or eating (except it be after the lapse of fifteen minutes for a young man and forty for an old man), nor after waking from sleep."" Q ""What of drinking fermented liquors?"" ""Doth not the prohibition suffice thee in the Book of Almighty Allah, where He saith, 'Verily, wine and lots and images, and the divining arrows are an abomination, of Satan's work; therefore avoid them, that ye may prosper'?[FN#405] And again, 'They will ask thee concerning wine and lots': Answer, 'In both there is great sin and also some things of use unto men: but their sinfulness is greater than their use.'[FN#406] Hence quoth the poet,

'O bibber of liquor, art not ashamed * To drink what Allah
       &nbsp     forbade thee drain?
Put it far from thee and approach it not; * It holds what Allah
       &nbsp     forbade as bane.'

And quoth another to the same purport,

'I drank the sin till my reason fled: * Ill drink that reason to loss misled!'

As for the advantages that be therein, it disperseth stone and gravel from the kidneys and strengtheneth the viscera and banisheth care, and moveth to generosity and preserveth health and digestion; it conserveth the body, expelleth disease from the joints, purifieth the frame of corrupt humours, engendereth cheerfulness, gladdeneth the heart of man and keepeth up the natural heat: it contracteth the bladder, enforceth the liver and removeth obstructions, reddeneth the cheeks, cleareth away maggots from the brain and deferreth grey hairs. In short, had not Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) forbidden it,[FN#407] there were not on the face of the earth aught fit to stand in its stead. As for gambling by lots, it is a game of hazard such as diceing, not of skill."" Q ""What wine is best?"" ""That which is pressed from white grapes and kept eighty days or more after fermentation: it resembleth not water and indeed there is nothing on the surface of the earth like unto it."" Q ""What sayest thou of cupping?"" ""It is for him who is over full of blood and who hath no defect therein; and whoso would be cupped, let it be during the wane of the moon, on a day without cloud, wind or rain and on the seventeenth of the month. If it fall on a Tuesday, it will be the more efficacious, and nothing is more salutary for the brain and eyes and for clearing the intellect than cupping.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel enumerated the benefits of cupping, quoth the doctor, ""What is the best time for cupping?"" ""One should be cupped 'on the spittle,' that is, in the morning before eating, for this fortifieth the wit and the memory. It is reported of the Prophet that, when anyone complained to him of a pain in the head or legs, he would bid him be cupped and after cupping not eat salt food, fasting, for it engendereth scurvy; neither eat sour things as curded milk[FN#408] immediately after cupping."" Q ""When is cupping to be avoided?"" ""On Sabbaths or Saturdays and Wednesdays; and let him who is cupped on these days blame none but himself. Moreover, one should not be cupped in very hot weather nor in very cold weather; and the best season for cupping is springtide."" Quoth the doctor, ""Now tell me of carnal copulation."" Hereupon Tawaddud hung her head, for shame and confusion before the Caliph's majesty; then said, ""By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, it is not that I am at fault, but that I am ashamed; though, indeed, the answer is on the edge of my tongue."" Said the Caliph; ""Speak, O damsel,"" whereupon said she, ""Copulation hath in it many and exceeding virtues and praiseworthy qualities, amongst which are, that it lighteneth a body full of black bile and calmeth the heat of love and induceth affection and dilateth the heart and dispelleth the sadness of solitude; and the excess of it is more harmful in summer and autumn than in spring and winter."" Q ""What are its good effects?"" ""It banisheth trouble and disquiet, calmeth love and wrath and is good for ulcers, especially in a cold and dry humour; on the other hand excess of it weakeneth the sight and engendereth pains in the legs and head and back: and beware, beware of carnal connection with old women, for they are deadly. Quoth the Iman Ali[FN#409] (whose face Allah honour!), 'Four things kill and ruin the body: entering the Hammam on a full stomach; eating salt food; copulation on a plethora of blood and lying with an ailing woman; for she will weaken thy strength and infect thy frame with sickness; and an old woman is deadly poison.' And quoth one of them, 'Beware of taking an old woman to wife, though she be richer in hoards than Kárún'""[FN#410] Q ""What is the best copulation?"" ""If the woman be tender of years, comely of shape, fair of face, swelling of breast and of noble race, she will add to thee strength and health of body; and let her be even as saith a certain poet describing her,

'Seeing thy looks wots she what thou desir'st, * By inspiration;
       &nbsp     wants nor word nor sign;
And, when thou dost behold her rarest grace, * The charms of
       &nbsp     every garden canst decline.'

Q ""At what time is copulation good?"" ""If by night, after food digested and if by day, after the morning meal."" Q ""What are the most excellent fruits?"" ""Pomegranate and citron."" Q ""Which is the most excellent of vegetables?"" ""Endive.[FN#411]"" Q ""Which of sweet-scented flowers?"" ""Rose and Violet."" Q ""How is the seed of man secreted?"" ""There is in man a vein which feedeth all the other veins. Now water is collected from the three hundred and sixty veins and, in the form of red blood, entereth the left testicle, where it is decocted, by the heat of temperament inherent in the son of Adam, into a thick, white liquid, whose odour is as that of the palm-spathe."" Q ""What flying thing is it that emitteth seed and menstruateth?"" ""The flitter-mouse,[FN#412] that is the bat."" Q ""What is that which, when confined and shut out from the air liveth, and when let out to smell the air dieth?"" ""The fish."" Q ""What serpent layeth eggs?"" ""The Su'ban or dragon.[FN#413]"" With this the physician waxed weary with much questioning, and held his peace, when Tawaddud said to the Caliph, ""O Commander of the Faithful, he hath questioned me till he is tired out and now I will ask him one question, which if he answer not, I will take his clothes as lawful prize.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel said to the Commander of the Faithful, ""Verily he hath questioned me till he is tired out, and now I will ask him one question, which if he answer not I will take his clothes as lawful prize,"" the Caliph cried, ""Ask on."" So quoth she to the physician, ""What is that thing which resembleth the earth in roundness, whose resting-place and whose spine are hidden from men's eyes; little of price and estimation; narrow of chest and shackled as to throat though it be nor runaway slave nor pestilent thief; thrust through and through, though not in fray, and wounded, though not in fight: time eateth its vigour and water wasteth it away; now it is beaten without blemish, and then made to serve without stint; united after separation; submissive, but not to him who caresseth it; pregnant without child in belly; drooping, yet not leaning on its side; becoming dirty yet purifying itself; cleaving to its fere, yet changing; copulating without a yard, wrestling without arms: resting and taking its ease; bitten, yet not crying out: now more complaisant than a cup-companion and then more troublesome than summer-heat; leaving its mate by night and embracing her by day and having its abode in the corners of the mansions of the noble?"" The physician was silent awhile in perplexity and his colour changed and he bowed his head and made no reply; whereupon she said to him, ""Ho, sir doctor, speak or doff thy dress."" At this, he rose and said, ""O Commander of the Faithful, bear witness against me that this damsel is more learned than I in medicine and what else, and that I cannot cope with her."" And he put off his clothes and fled forth. Quoth the Caliph to Tawaddud, ""Ree us thy riddle,"" and she replied, ""O Commander of the Faithful, it is the button and the button-loop.[FN#414]""—Then she undertook the astronomers and said, ""Let him of you who is an astronomer rise and come forward."" So the astronomer advanced and sat down before her; and, when she saw him, she laughed and said, ""Art thou the astronomer, the mathematician, the scribe?"" ""Yes,"" answered he. Quoth she, ""Ask of what thou wilt; success resteth with Allah."" So he said, ""Tell me of the sun and its rising and setting."" And she replied: ""Know that the sun riseth from the shadows in the Eastern hemisphere and setteth in the shadows of the Western, and each hemisphere compriseth one hundred and eighty degrees. Quoth Allah Almighty, 'I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West.'[FN#415] And again, 'He it is who hath ordained the sun to shine by day, and the moon for a light by night; and hath appointed her station that ye might know the number of years and the computation of time.'[FN#416] The moon is Sultan of the night and the sun Sultan of the day, and they vie with each other in their courses and follow without overtaking each other. Quoth Almighty Allah, 'It is not expedient that the sun overtake the moon in her course; neither doth the night outstrip the day, but each of these luminaries moveth in a peculiar orbit.'""[FN#417] Q ""When the day cometh, what becometh of the night; and what of the day, when the night cometh?"" ""He causeth the night to enter in upon the day, and He causeth the day to enter in upon the night.""[FN#418] Q ""Enumerate to me the mansions of the moon?""[FN#419] ""They number eight-and-twenty, to wit, Sharatán, Butayn, Surayá, Dabarán, Hak'ah, Han'ah, Zirá'a, Nasrah, Tarf, Jabhah, Zubrah, Sarfah, 'Awwá, Simák, Ghafar, Zubání, Iklíl, Kalb, Shaulah, Na'am, Baldah, Sa'ad al-Zábih, Sa'ad al-Bul'a, Sa'ad al-Su'úd, Sa'ad al-Akhbiyah, Fargh the Former and Fargh the Latter; and Risháa. They are disposed in the order of the letters of the Abjad-hawwaz or older alphabet,[FN#420] according to their numerical power, and in them are secret virtues which none knoweth save Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and the stablished in science. They are divided among the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, two Mansions and a third of a Mansion to each Sign. Thus Sharatan, Butayn and one-third of Suráyá, belong to Aries, the other two-thirds of Suráyá, Dabaran and two-thirds of Hak'ah to Taurus, the other third of Hak'ah, Han'ah and Zira'a to Gemini; Nasrah, Tarf and a third of Jabhah to Cancer, the other two-thirds of Jabhah, Zubrah and two-thirds of Sarfah to Leo; the other third of Sarfah, 'Awwá and Simák to Virgo; Ghafar, Zubáni and one-third of Iklíl to Libra; the other two-thirds of Iklil, Kalb and two-thirds of Shaulah to Scorpio; the other third of Shaulah, Na'áim and Baldah to Sagittarius; Sa'ad al-Zábih, Sa'ad al-Bul'a and one-third of Sa'ad al-Su'ud to Capricorn, the other two-thirds of Sa'ad al-Su'dd, Sa'ad al-Akhbiyah and two-thirds of Fargh the Former to Aquarius, the other third of Fargh the Former, Fargh the Latter and Risháa to Pisces.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,

She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel enumerated the Mansions and distributed them into their Signs, the astronomer said, ""Thou hast replied aright; now tell me of the planets and their natures, also of their sojourn in the Zodiacal Signs, their aspects, auspicious and sinister, their houses, ascendants and descendants. She answered, ""The sitting is narrow for so large a matter, but I will say as much as I can. Now the planets number seven; which are, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Sun, hot-dry, sinister in conjunction, favourable in opposition, abideth thirty days in each Sign. The Moon, cold-moist and favourable of aspect, tarrieth in each Sign two days and a third of another day. Mercury is of a mixed nature, favourable in conjunction with the favourable, and sinister in conjunction with the sinister aspects, and abideth in each sign seventeen days and a half day. Venus, temperate and favourable, abideth in each sign five-and-twenty days. Mars is sinister and woneth in each sign ten months. Jupiter is auspicious and abideth in each sign a year. Saturn, cold-dry and sinister, tarrieth in each sign thirty months. The house of the Sun is Leo, her ascendant is Aries, and her descendant Aquarius. The Moon's house is Cancer, his ascendant Taurus, his descendant Scorpio and his sinister aspect Capricorn. Saturn's house is Capricorn-Aquarius, his ascendant Libra, his descendant Aries and his sinister aspects Cancer and Leo. Jupiter's house is Pisces-Sagittarius, his ascendant Cancer, his descendant Capricorn and his sinister aspects Gemini and Leo. Venus's house is Taurus, her ascendant Pisces, her descendant Libra, and her sinister aspects Aries and Scorpio. Mercury's house is Gemini-Virgo, his ascendant Virgo, his descendant Pisces, and his sinister aspect Taurus. Mars' house is Aries-Scorpio, his ascendant Capricorn, his descendant Cancer and his sinister aspect Libra."" Now when the astronomer saw her acuteness and comprehensive learning and heard her fair answers, he bethought him for a sleight to confound her before the Commander of the Faithful, and said to her, ""O damsel, tell me, will rain fall this month?"" At this she bowed her head and pondered so long, that the Caliph thought her at a loss for an answer and the astronomer said to her, ""Why dost thou not speak?"" Quoth she, ""I will not speak except the Commander of the Faithful give me leave."" So the Caliph laughed and said, ""How so?"" Cried she ""I would have thee give me a sword, that I may strike off his head, for he is an Infidel, an Agnostic, an Atheist.[FN#421]"" At this, loud laughed the Caliph and those about him laughed, and she continued ""O astronomer, there are five things that none knoweth save Allah Almighty;"" and she repeated the verset; ""'Aye! Allah!—with Him is the knowledge of the hour and He causeth the rain to descend at His own appointed time —and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females—but no soul knoweth what it shall have gotten on the morrow; neither wotteth any soul in what land it shall die: Verily Allah is knowing, informed of all.'""[FN#422] Quoth the astronomer, ""Thou hast said well, and I, by Allah, thought only to try thee."" Rejoined she, ""Know that the almanack-makers have certain signs and tokens, referring to the planets and constellations relative to the coming in of the year; and folk have learned something by experience."" Q ""What be that?"" ""Each day hath a planet that ruleth it: so if the first day in the year fall on First Day (Sunday) that day is the Sun's and this portendeth (though Allah alone is All-knowing!) oppression of kings and sultans and governors and much miasma and lack of rain; and that people will be in great tumult and the grain-crop will be good, except lentils, which will perish, and the vines will rot and flax will be dear and wheat cheap from the beginning of Túbah to the end of Barmahát.[FN#423] And, in this year there will be much fighting among kings, and there shall be great plenty of good in this year, but Allah is All-knowing!"" Q ""What if the first day fall on Second Day (Monday)?"" ""That day belongeth to the Moon and portendeth righteousness in administrators and officials and that it will be a year of much rain and grain-crops will be good, but linseed will decay and wheat will be cheap in the month Kiyáhk;[FN#424] also the plague will rage and the sheep and goats will die, grapes will be plentiful and honey scarce and cotton cheap; and Allah is omniscient!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,

She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel ended her notice of Second Day the astronomer said to her ""Now tell me what will occur if New Year's day fall on Third Day (Tuesday)."" She replied, ""That is Mars' day and portendeth death of great men and much destruction and deluge of blood and dearness of grain; lack of rain and scarcity of fish, which will anon be in excess and anon fail. Lentils and honey in this year will be cheap and linseed dear and only barley will thrive, to the exception of all other cereals: great will be the fighting among kings and death will be in the blood and there will be much mortality among asses."" Q ""What if it fall on Fourth Day?"" ""That is Mercury's day and portendeth great tumult among the folk and much enmity and, though rains be moderate, rotting of some of the green crops; also that there will be sore mortality among cattle and young children and much fighting by sea; that wheat will be dear from Barmúdah to Misra[FN#425] and other grains cheap; thunder and lightning will abound and honey will be dear, palm- trees will thrive and bear abundantly and flax and cotton will be plentiful, while radishes and onions will be dear; but Allah is All-knowing!"" Q ""What if it fall on Fifth Day?"" ""That is Jupiter's day and portendeth equity in Wazirs and righteousness in Kazis and Fakirs and the Ministers of religion; and that good will be plentiful: rains and fruit and trees and grain will abound, and flax, cotton, honey, grapes and fish be cheap; and Allah is Omniscient!"" Q ""What if it fall on Meeting Day or Friday?"" ""That day appertaineth to Venus and portendeth oppression in the chiefs of the Jinn and talk of forgery and back-biting; there will be much dew; the autumn crops will be good in the land and there will be cheapness in one town and not in another: ungraciousness will be rife by land and sea; linseed will be dear, also wheat, in Hátúr, but cheap in Amshír; honey will be dear and grapes and water-melons will rot; and Allah is Omniscient!"" Q ""What if it fall on the Sabbath (Saturday)?"" ""That is Saturn's day and portendeth the preferment of slaves and Greeks and those in whom there is no good, neither in their neighbourhood; there will be great drought and dearth; clouds will abound and death will be rife among the sons of Adam and woe to the people of Egypt and Syria from the oppression of the Sultan and failure of blessing upon the green crops and rotting of grain; and Allah is All-knowing!""[FN#426] Now with this, the astronomer hung his head very low, and she said to him, ""O astronomer, I will ask thee one question, which if thou answer not, I will take thy clothes."" ""Ask,"" replied he. Quoth she, ""Where is Saturn's dwelling-place?""; and he answered, ""In the seventh heaven."" Q ""And that of Jupiter?"" ""In the sixth heaven."" Q ""And that of Mars?"" ""In the fifth heaven."" Q ""And that of the Sun?"" ""In the fourth heaven."" Q ""And that of Venus?"" ""In the third heaven."" Q ""And that of Mercury?"" ""In the second heaven."" Q ""And that of the Moon?"" ""In the first heaven."" Quoth she, ""Well answered; but I have one more question to ask thee;"" and quoth he, ""Ask!"" Accordingly she said, ""Now tell me concerning the stars, into how many parts are they divided."" But he was silent and answered nothing; and she cried to him, ""Put off thy clothes."" So he doffed them and she took them; after which the Caliph said to her, ""Tell us the answer to thy question."" She replied: ""O Commander of the Faithful, the stars are divided into three parts, whereof one-third is hung in the sky of the earth,[FN#427] as it were lamps, to give light to the earth, and a part is used to shoot the demons withal, when they draw near by stealth to listen to the talk in heaven. Quoth Allah Almighty, 'Verily, we have dight the sky of the earth with the adornment of the stars; and have appointed them for projectiles against every rebellious Satan.'[FN#428] And the third part is hung in air to illuminate the seas and give light to what is therein."" Quoth the astronomer, ""I have one more question to ask, which if she answer, I will avow myself beaten."" ""Say on,"" answered she.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the astronomer said, ""Now tell me what four contraries are based upon other four contraries?"" Replied she, ""The four qualities of Caloric and Frigoric, Humidity and Siccity; for of heat Allah created fire, whose nature is hot-dry; of dryness, earth, which is cold-dry; of cold, water which is cold-wet; of moisture, air, which is hot-wet. Moreover, He created twelve Signs of the Zodiac, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces; and appointed them of the four humours; three fiery, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; three earthly, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; three airy, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius; and three watery, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces."" Hereupon the astronomer rose, and saying, ""Bear witness against me that she is more learned than I,"" away he went beaten. Then quoth the Caliph, ""Where is the philosopher[FN#429]?""; at which one rose hastily and came forward and said to Tawaddud, ""What is Time and what be its limits, and its days, and what things bringeth it?"" Replied she, ""Time is a term applied to the hours of the night and day, which are but the measures of the courses of the sun and moon in their several heavens, even as Allah Almighty telleth us when he saith, 'A sign to them also is the Night, from which we strip off the day, and lo! they are plunged in darkness, and the Sun runneth to her place of rest; this is the ordinance of the Sublime, the All-knowing.'""[FN#430] Q ""How cometh unbelief to the son of Adam?"" ""It is reported of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and preserve!) that he said, 'Unbelief in a man runneth as the blood runneth in his veins, when he revileth the world and Time and night and the Hour.' And again, 'Let none of you revile Time, for Time is God; neither revile the world, for she saith, 'May Allah not aid him who revileth me!;' neither revile the hour, for, 'The Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt thereof';[FN#431] neither revile the earth, for it is a portent, according to the saying of the Most High, 'Out of the ground have we created you, and into the same will we cause you to return, and we will bring you forth yet thence another time.'""[FN#432] Q ""What are the five that ate and drank, yet came not out of loins nor womb?"" ""Adam and Simeon[FN#433] and Salih's she-camel[FN#434] and Ishmael's ram and the bird that Abu Bakr the Truth-teller saw in the cave.[FN#435]"" Q ""Tell me of five that are in Paradise and are neither humans, Jinns nor angels?"" ""Jacob's wolf and the Seven Sleepers' dog and Esdras's ass and Salih's camel and Duldul the mule of the Prophet (upon whom be blessings and peace!)."" Q ""What man prayed a prayer neither on earth nor in heaven?"" ""Solomon, when he prayed on his carpet, borne by the wind."" Q ""Ree me this riddle:—A man once looked at a handmaid during dawn-prayer, and she was unlawful to him; but, at noonday she became lawful to him: by mid-afternoon,, she was again unlawful, but at sundown, she was lawful to him: at supper time she was a third time unlawful, but by daybreak, she became once more lawful to him."" ""This was a man who looked at another's slave-girl in the morning, and she was then unlawful to him; but at midday he bought her, and she became lawful to him: at mid-afternoon he freed her, and she became unlawful to him; but at sundown he married her and she was again lawful to him. At nightfall he divorced her and she was then a third time unlawful to him; but, next morning at daybreak, he took her back, and she became once more lawful to him."" Q ""Tell me what tomb went about with him that lay buried therein?"" ""Jonah's whale, when it had swallowed him."" Q ""What spot of lowland is it, upon which the sun shone once, but will never again shine till Judgment-Day?"" ""The bottom of the Red Sea, when Moses smote it with his staff, and the sea clave asunder in twelve places, according to the number of the tribes;[FN#436] then the sun shone on the bottom and will do so nevermore until Judgment-Day."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the philosopher then addressed the damsel saying, ""What was the first skirt that trailed over the face of the earth?"" She replied, ""That of Hagar, out of shame before Sarah; and it became a custom among the Arabs."" Q ""What is that which breatheth without life?"" ""Quoth Almighty Allah, 'By the morning when it breatheth!'""[FN#437] Q ""Ree me this riddle:—A number of pigeons came to a high tree and lighted, some on the tree and others under it. Said those on the tree to those on the ground, 'If one of you come up to us, ye will be a third part of us all in number; and if one of us descend to you, we shall be like unto you in number,' How many pigeons were there in all?"" ""Twelve: seven alighted on the tree and five beneath; and, if one go up, those above would be eight to four; and, if one go down, both would be six and Allah is all-knowing.""[FN#438] With this the philosopher put off his clothes and fled: whereupon the next contest took place, for she turned to the Olema present and said, ""Which of you is the rhetorician that can discourse of all arts and sciences?"" There came forward a sage hight Ibrahim bin Siyyár and said to her, ""Think me not like the rest."" Quoth she, ""It is the more assured to me that thou wilt be beaten, for that thou art a boaster; and Allah will help me to victory over thee, that I may strip thee of thy clothes. So, if thou sentest one to fetch thee wherewithal to cover thyself, 'twould be well for thee."" Cried he, ""By Allah, I will assuredly conquer thee and make thee a byword among the peoples, generation after generation!"" Rejoined she, ""Do penance in advance for thy broken oath."" Then he asked, ""What five things did Allah create before he made man?""; and she answered, ""Water and earth and light and darkness and the fruits of the earth."" Q ""What did Allah create with the hand of omnipotence?"" ""The 'Arsh, throne of God or the empyreal heaven and the tree Túbá[FN#439] and Adam and the garden of Eden; these Allah created with the hand of His omnipotence; but to all other created things He said, 'Be,'—and they were."" Q ""Who is thy father in Al-Islam?"" ""Mohammed, whom Allah bless and preserve!"" Q ""Who was the father in Al-Islam of Mohammed?"" ""Abraham, the Friend of God."" Q ""What is the Faith of Al-Islam?"" ""The professing that there is no god but the God and that Mohammed is the apostle of God."" Q ""What is thy first and thy last?"" ""My first is man's seed in the shape of foul water and my last filthy carrion: the first of me is dust and the last of me is dust. Quoth the poet,

'Of dust was I created, and man did I become, * In question ever
       &nbsp     ready and aye fluent in reply,
Then, I unto the dust return'd, became of it again, * For that,
       &nbsp    in very deed, of dust at first create was I.'""

He continued, ""What thing was it, whose first state was wood and its last life?"" ""Moses' staff,[FN#440] when he cast it on the valley-ground and it became, by permission of Allah, a writhing serpent."" Q ""What is the meaning of the word of the Lord, 'And I have other occasion for it?'""[FN#441] ""He, Moses, was wont to plant his staff in the ground, and it would flower and fruit and shade him from the heat and from the cold. Moreover, it would carry him when he was weary, and whilst he slept, guard his sheep from lions and wild beasts."" Q ""What woman was born of a man alone and what man of a woman alone?"" ""Eve of Adam and Jesus of Mary.[FN#442]"" Q ""Tell me of the four fires, what fire eateth and drinketh; what fire eateth but drinketh not; what fire drinketh but eateth not and what other neither eateth nor drinketh?"" ""The fire of the world eateth but drinketh not; the fire which eateth and drinketh is Hell-fire; the fire of the sun drinketh but eateth not, and the fire of the moon neither eateth nor drinketh."" Q ""Which is the open door and which the shut?"" ""The Traditional Ordinances are the open door, the Koranic the shut door."" Q ""Of what doth the poet speak, when he saith,

'And dweller in the tomb whose food is at his head, * When he
       &nbsp     eateth of that meat, of words he waxeth fain:
He riseth and he walketh and he talketh without tongue; * And
       &nbsp     returneth to the tomb where his kith and kin are lain.
No living wight is he, yet, in honour he abides; * Nor dead yet
       &nbsp     he deserveth that Allah him assain.'""

She replied, ""The reed-pen.""[FN#443] Quoth he ""What doth the poet refer to in these verses,

'Two vests in one; blood flowing easiest wise; * Rosy red ears
       &nbsp     and mouth wide open lies;
It hath a cock-like form, its belly pecks * And, if you price it,
       &nbsp     half a dirham buys.'""

She replied, ""The ink-case."" Quoth he, ""And in these,

'Ho say to men of wisdom, wit and lore * To sapient, reverend,
       &nbsp    clever counsellor:
Tell me what was't you saw that bird bring forth * When wandering
       &nbsp     Arab-land and Ajam o'er?
No flesh it beareth and it hath no blood, * Nor down nor any
       &nbsp     feathers e'er it wore.
'Tis eaten cooked and eke 'tis eaten cold; * 'Tis eaten buried
       &nbsp     'neath the flames that roar:
It showeth twofold colours, silver white * And yellow brighter
       &nbsp     than pure golden ore:
'Tis not seen living or we count it dead: * So ree my riddle rich
       &nbsp     in marvel-store!'""
She replied, ""Thou makest longsome the questioning anent an egg worth a mite."" Q ""And this?,

'I waved to and fro and he waved to and fro, * With a motion so
       &nbsp     pleasant, now fast and now slow;
And at last he sunk down on my bosom of snow; * 'Your lover
       &nbsp     friend?'""

""No friend, my fan;""[FN#444] said she. Q ""How many words did Allah speak to Moses?"" ""It is related of the Apostle that he said, 'God spoke to Moses fifteen hundred and fifteen words.'"" Q ""Tell me of fourteen things that speak to the Lord of the Worlds?"" ""The seven heavens and the seven earths, when they say, 'We come obedient to Thy command.'""[FN#445]—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel made the answer, the philosopher continued, ""Tell me of Adam and how he was first created?"" and she said, ""Allah created Adam of clay: the clay He made of foam and the foam of the sea, the sea of darkness, darkness of light, light of a fish, the fish of a rock, the rock of a ruby, the ruby of water, and the water He created by His Omnipotence according to His saying (exalted be His name!), 'His commandment when He willeth aught, is but to say, BE,—and IT IS.'""[FN#446] Q ""What is meant by the poet in these verses,

'And eater lacking mouth and even maw; * Yet trees and beasts to
       &nbsp     it are daily bread:
Well fed it thrives and shows a lively life, * But give it water
       &nbsp     and you do it dead?'""

""This,"" quoth she, ""is Fire."" ""And in these;"" he asked,

""Two lovers barred from every joy and bliss, * Who through the
       &nbsp     livelong night embracing lie:
They guard the folk from all calamities, * But with the rising
       &nbsp    sun apart they fly?""

She answered, ""The leaves of a door."" Quoth he, ""Tell me of the gates of Gehenna?"" Quoth she, ""They are seven in number and their names are comprised in these two couplets,

'Jahannam, next Lazá, and third Hatím; * Then count Sa'ír and
       &nbsp     Sakar eke, five-fold,
Sixth comes Jahím and Háwiyah the seventh; * Here are seven Hells
       &nbsp     in four lines briefly told.'""

Quoth he ""To what doth the poet refer when he saith,

'She wears a pair of ringlets long let down * Behind her, as she
       &nbsp    comes and goes at speed,
And eye that never tastes of sleep nor sheds * A tear, for ne'er
       &nbsp     a drop it hath at need;
That never all its life wore stitch of clothes; * Yet robes
       &nbsp     mankind in every-mode of weed?'""

Quoth she, ""A needle."" Q ""What is the length and what the breadth of the bridge Al-Sirát?"" ""Its length is three thousand years' journey, a thousand in descent and a thousand in ascent and a thousand level: it is sharper than a sword and finer than a hair.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Sixtieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had described to him Al-Sirat, the philosopher said, ""Inform me how many intercessions with Allah hath the Prophet for each soul?""[FN#447] ""Three."" Q ""Was Abu Bakr the first who embraced Al-Islam?"" ""Yes."" Q ""Yet Ali became a Moslem before him?"" ""Ali came to the Prophet, when he was a boy of seven years old, for Allah vouchsafed him knowledge of the way of salvation in his tender youth, so that he never prostrated himself to idols."" Quoth he, ""Tell me which is the more excellent, Ali or Abbás?"" Now she knew that, in propounding this question, Ibrahim was laying a trap for her; for if she said, ""Ali is more excellent than Abbas,"" she would lack excuse with the Caliph for undervaluing his ancestor; so she bowed her head awhile, now reddening, then paling, and lastly said, ""Thou askest me of two excellent men, each having his own excellence. Let us return to what we were about."" When the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard her, he stood up and said, ""Thou hast spoken well, by the Lord of the Ka'abah, O Tawaddud!"" Then quoth Ibrahim the rhetorician, ""What meaneth the poet when he saith,

'Slim-wasted one, whose taste is sweetest-sweet, * Likest a lance
       &nbsp     whereon no head we scan:
And all the lieges find it work them weal, * Eaten of afternoon
       &nbsp     in Ramazan.'""

She answered, ""The sugar-cane;"" and he said, ""Tell me of many things."" Asked she, ""What are they?"" and he said, ""What is sweeter than honey; what is sharper than the sword; what is swifter than poison; what is the delight of a moment and what the contentment of three days; what is the pleasantest of days; what is the joy of a week; what is that debt the worst debtor denieth not; what is the prison of the tomb; what is the joy of the heart; what is the snare of the soul; what is death-in-life; what is the disease that may not be healed; what is the shame that may not be wiped off; what is the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts?"" Quoth she, ""Hear what I shall say in reply; then put off thy clothes, that I may explain to thee;"" and the Caliph said, ""Expound, and he shall doff his clothes."" So she said, ""Now that, which is sweeter than honey, is the love of pious children to their two parents; that, which is sharper than the sword, is the tongue; that, which is swifter than poison, is the Envier's eye; the delight of a moment is carnal copulation and the contentment of three days is the depilatory for women; the pleasantest of days is that of profit on merchandise; the joy of a week is the bride; the debt, which the worst debtor denieth not, is death; the prison of the tomb is a bad son; the joy of the heart is a woman obedient to her husband (and it is said also that, when fleshmeat descendeth upon the heart, it rejoiceth therein); the snare of the soul is a disobedient slave; death-in-life is poverty; the disease that may not be healed is an ill-nature, and the shame that may not be wiped away is an ill daughter; lastly, the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts, is the locust, whose head is as the head of a horse, its neck as the neck of the bull, its wings as the wings of the vulture, its feet as the feet of the camel, its tail as the tail of the serpent, its belly as the belly of the scorpion and its horns as the horns of the gazelle."" The Caliph was astounded at her quickness and understanding, and said to the rhetorician, ""Doff thy clothes."" So he rose up and cried, ""I call all who are present in this assembly to witness that she is more learned than I and every other learned man."" And he put off his clothes and gave them to her, saying, ""Take them and may Allah not bless them to thee!"" So the Caliph ordered him fresh clothes and said, ""O Tawaddud, there is one thing left of that for which thou didst engage, namely, chess."" And he sent for experts of chess and cards[FN#448] and trictrac. The chess-player sat down before her, and they set the pieces, and he moved and she moved; but, every move he made she speedily countered,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel was playing chess with the expert in presence of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, whatever move he made was speedily countered by her, till she beat him and he found himself checkmated. Quoth he, ""I did but lead thee on, that thou mightest think thyself skilful: but set up again, and thou shalt see."" So they placed the pieces a second time, when he said in himself, ""Open thine eyes or she will beat thee."" And he fell to moving no piece, save after calculation, and ceased not to play, till she said, ""Thy King is dead!—Checkmate."" When he saw this he was confounded at her quickness and understanding; but she laughed and said, ""O professor, I will make a wager with thee on this third game. I will give thee the queen and the right-hand castle and the left-hand knight; if thou beat me, take my clothes, and if I beat thee, I will take thy clothes."" Replied he, ""I agree to this;"" and they replaced the pieces, she removing queen, castle and knight.[FN#449] Then said she, ""Move, O master."" So he moved, saying to himself, ""I cannot but beat her, with such odds,"" and planned a combination; but, behold, she moved on, little by little, till she made one of her pawns[FN#450] a queen and pushing up to him pawns and other pieces, to take off his attention, set one in his way and tempted him to take it. Accordingly, he took it and she said to him, ""The measure is meted and the loads equally balanced.[FN#451] Eat till thou are over-full; naught shall be thy ruin, O son of Adam, save thy greed. Knowest thou not that I did but tempt thee, that I might finesse thee? See: this is check-mate!"" adding, ""So doff off thy clothes."" Quoth he, ""Leave me my bag-trousers, so Allah repay thee;"" and he swore by Allah that he would contend with none, so long as Tawaddud abode in the realm of Baghdad. Then he stripped off his clothes and gave them to her and went away. Thereupon came the backgammon-player, and she said to him, ""If I beat thee, this day, what wilt thou give me?"" Quoth he, ""I will give thee ten suits of brocade of Constantinople, figured with gold, and ten suits of velvet and a thousand gold pieces; and if I beat thee, I ask nothing but that thou write me an acknowledgment of my victory."" Quoth she, ""To it, then, and do thy best."" So they played, and he lost and went away, chattering in Frankish jargon and saying, ""By the bounty of the Commander of the Faithful, there is not her like in all the regions of the world!"" Then the Caliph summoned players on instruments of music and asked her, ""Dost thou know aught of music?""; when she answered, ""Even so!"" He bade bring a worn lute, polished by use, whose owner forlorn and lone was by parting trodden down; and of which quoth one, describing it

""Allah watered a land, and upsprang a tree * Struck root deep
       &nbsp     down, and raised head a-sky:
The birds o'ersang it when green its wood; * And the Fair
       &nbsp     o'ersing now the wood is dry.""

So they brought the lute in a bag of red satin, with tassels of saffron-coloured silk: and she opened the bag, and took it out and behold on it was graven,

""Oft hath a tender bough made lute for maid, * whose swift sweet
       &nbsp     lays at feast men's hearts invade:
She sings; it follows on her song, as though * The
       &nbsp     Bulbuls[FN#452] taught her all the modes she played.""

She laid her lute in her lap and with bosom inclining over it, bent to it with the bending of a mother who suckleth her child; then she preluded in twelve different modes, till the whole assembly was agitated with delight, like a waving sea, and she sang the following,

""Cut short this strangeness, leave unruth of you; * My heart
       &nbsp     shall love you aye, by youth of you!
Have ruth on one who sighs and weeps and moans, * Pining and
       &nbsp     yearning for the troth of you.""

The Caliph was ravished and exclaimed, ""Allah bless thee and be merciful to him who taught thee!"": whereupon she rose and kissed the ground before him. Then he sent for money and paid her master Abu al-Husn an hundred thousand gold pieces to her price; after which he said to her, ""O Tawaddud, ask a boon of me!"" Replied she, ""I ask of thee that thou restore me to my lord who sold me."" ""'Tis well,"" answered the Caliph and restored her to her master and gave her five thousand dinars for herself. Moreover, he appointed Abu al-Husn one of his cup-companions for a permanence,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph gave the damsel five thousand dinars for herself and restored her to her master whom he appointed one of his cup-companions for a permanence and assigned him a monthly stipend of a thousand dinars so long as he should live; and he abode with the damsel Tawaddud in all solace and delight of life. Marvel then, O King, at the eloquence of this damsel and the hugeness of her learning and understanding and her perfect excellence in all branches of art and science; and consider the generosity of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, in that he gave her master this money and said to her, ""Ask a boon of me;"" and she besought him to restore her to her lord. So he restored her to him and gave her five thousand dinars for herself and made him one of his boon-companions. Where is such generosity to be found after the Abbaside Caliphs?—May Allah Almighty have mercy upon them, one and all! And they tell a tale of



Footnotes:


[FN#281] Lane (ii. 636) omits this tale, ""as it would not only require a volume of commentary but be extremely tiresome to most readers."" Quite true; but it is valuable to Oriental Students who are beginning their studies, as an excellent compendium of doctrine and practice according to the Shafi'í School.

[FN#282] Pronounced Aboo 'l-Husn = Father of Beauty, a fancy name.

[FN#283] As in most hot climates so in Egypt the dead are buried at once despite the risk of vivisepulture. This seems an instinct with the Semitic (Arabian) race teste Abraham, as with the Gypsy. Hence the Moslems have invoked religious aid. The Mishkát al-Masábih (i. 387) makes Mohammed say, ""When any one of you dieth you may not keep him in the house but bear him quickly to his grave""; and again, ""Be quick in raising up the bier: for if the dead have been a good man, it is good to bear him gravewards without delay; and if bad, it is frowardness ye put from your necks.""

[FN#284] This biting of the hand in Al-Haríri expresses bitterness of repentance and he uses more than once the Koranic phrase (chapter vii., 148) ""Sukita fí aydíhim,"" lit. where it (the biting) was fallen upon their hands; i.e. when it repented them; ""sukita"" being here not a passive verb as it appears, but an impersonal form uncommon in Arabic. The action is instinctive, a survival of the days when man was a snarling and snapping animal (physically) armed only with claws and teeth.

[FN#285] Arab. ""'Alam,"" applied to many things, an ""old man"" of stones (Kákúr), a signpost with a rag on the top, etc.

[FN#286] The moon of Ramazan was noticed in Night ix. That of Sha'aban (eighth month) begins the fighting month after the conclusion of the Treuga Dei in Rajab. See Night ccclxxviii.

[FN#287] These lines have occurred in Night cccxix. I give Mr.
Payne's version for variety.

[FN#288] i.e. in her prime, at fourteen to fifteen.

[FN#289] i.e. pale and yellow.

[FN#290] The word means the wood; but it alludes to a preparation made by levigating it on a stone called in India ""Sandlásá."" The gruel-like stuff is applied with the right hand to the right side of the neck, drawing the open fingers from behind forwards so as to leave four distinct streaks, then down to the left side, and so on to the other parts of the body.

[FN#291] Arab. ""Haykal"" which included the Porch, the Holy and
the Holy of Holies. The word is used as in a wider sense by
Josephus A. J. v. v. 3. In Moslem writings it is applied to a
Christian Church generally, on account of its images.

[FN#292] These lines having occurred before, I here quote Mr.
Payne.

[FN#293] Arab writers often mention the smile of beauty, but rarely, after European fashion, the laugh, which they look upon as undignified. A Moslem will say ""Don't guffaw (Kahkahah) in that way; leave giggling and grinning to monkeys and Christians."" The Spaniards, a grave people, remark that Christ never laughed. I would draw the reader's attention to a theory of mine that the open-hearted laugh has the sound of the vowels a and o; while e, i, and u belong to what may be roughly classed as the rogue order.

[FN#294] i.e. gaining the love of another, love.

[FN#295] i.e. the abrogated passages and those by which they are abrogated. This division is necessary for ""inspired volumes,"" which always abound in contradictions. But the charge of ""opportunism"" brought against the Koran is truly absurd; as if ""revelation"" could possibly be aught save opportune.

[FN#296] Koran iv. 160, the chapter ""Women.""

[FN#297] She unveiled, being a slave-girl and for sale. If a free woman show her face to a Moslem, he breaks out into violent abuse, because the act is intended to let him know that he is looked upon as a small boy or an eunuch or a Chriastian—in fact not a man.

[FN#298] Ilah=Heb. El, a most difficult root, meaning strength, interposition, God (Numen) ""the"" (article) ""don't"" (do not), etc. etc.

[FN#299] As far as I know Christians are the only worshippers who kneel as if their lower legs were cut off and who ""join hands"" like the captive offering his wrists to be bound (dare manus). The posture, however, is not so ignoble as that of the Moslem ""Sijdah"" (prostration) which made certain North African tribes reject Al-Islam saying, ""These men show their hind parts to heaven.""

[FN#300] i.e. saying ""I intend (purpose) to pray (for instance) the two-bow prayer (ruka'tayn) of the day-break,"" etc.

[FN#301] So called because it prohibits speaking with others till the prayer is ended.

[FN#302] Lit. ""any thing opposite;"" here used for the Ka'abah towards which men turn in prayer; as Guebres face the sun or fire and idolators their images. ""Al-Kiblatayn"" (= the two Kiblahs) means Meccah and Jerusalem, which was faced by Moslems as well as Jews and Christians till Mohammed changed the direction. For the occasion of the change see my Pilgrimage, ii. 320.

[FN#303] Which includes Tayammum or washing with sand. This is a very cleanly practice in a hot, dry land and was adopted long before Mohammed. Cedrenus tells of baptism with sand being administered to a dying traveller in the African desert.

[FN#304] The Koranic order for Wuzú is concise and as usual obscure, giving rise to a host of disputes and casuistical questions. Its text runs (chapt. v.), ""O true believers, when you prepare to pray, wash (Ghusl) your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub (Mas-h) your hands and your feet unto the ankles; and if ye be unclean by having lain with a woman, wash (Ghusl) yourselves all over."" The purifications and ceremonious ablutions of the Jews originated this command; and the early Christians did very unwisely in not making the bath obligatory. St. Paul (Heb. xi. 22) says, ""Let us draw near with a true heart…having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean (or pure) water."" But this did not suffice. Hence the Eastern Christian, in hot climates where cleanliness should rank before godliness, is distinguished by his dirt which as a holy or reverend man he makes still dirtier, and he offers an ugly comparison with the Moslem and especially the Hindu. The neglect of commands to wash and prohibitions to drink strong waters are the two grand physical objections of the Christian code of morality.
[FN#305] Arab. ""Istinshák""=snuffing up water from the palm of the right hand so as to clean thoroughly the nostrils. This ""function"" is unreasonably neglected in Europe, to the detriment of the mucous membrane and the olfactory nerves.

[FN#306] So as to wash between them. The thick beard is combed out with the fingers.

[FN#307] Poor human nature! How sad to compare ita pretensions with its actualities.

[FN#308] Complete ablution is rendered necessary chiefly by the emission of semen either in copulation or in nocturnal pollution. The water must be pure and not less than a certain quantity, and it must touch every part of the skin beginning with the right half of the person and ending with the left. Hence a plunge-bath is generally preferred.

[FN#309] Arab. ""Ta'mím,"" lit. crowning with turband, or tiara, here=covering, i.e. wetting.

[FN#310] This practice (saying ""I purpose to defer the washing of the feet,"" etc.) is now somewhat obsolete.

[FN#311] Arabs have a prejudice against the hydropathic treatment of wounds, holding that water poisons them: and, as the native produce usually contains salt, soda and magnesia, they are justified by many cases. I once tried water-bandages in Arabia and failed dismally.

[FN#312] The sick man says his prayers lying in bed, etc., and as he best can.

[FN#313] i.e. saying, ""And peace be on us and on the worshippers of Allah which be pious.""

[FN#314] i.e. saying, "" I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the
Stoned.""

[FN#315] Certain parts should be recited aloud (jahr) and others sotto voce (with mussitation=Khafi). No mistake must be made in this matter where a Moslem cannot err.

[FN#316] Hence an interest of two-and-a-half percent is not held to be ""Ribá"" or unlawful gain of money by money, usury.

[FN#317] The meal must be finished before the faster can plainly distinguish the white thread from the black thread (Koran ii. 183); some understand this literally, others apply it to the dark and silvery streak of zodiacal light which appears over the Eastern horizon an hour or so before sunrise. The fast then begins and ends with the disappearance of the sun. I have noticed its pains and penalties in my Pilgrimage, i. 110, etc.

[FN#318] For the ""Azán"" or call to prayer see Lane, M. E., chapt. xviii. The chant, however, differs in every country, and a practical ear will know the land by its call.

[FN#319] Arab. ""Hadís"" or saying of the Apostle.

[FN#320] ""Al-I'itikaf"" resembles the Christian ""retreat;"" but the worshipper generally retires to a mosque, especially in Meccah. The Apostle practised it on Jabal Hira and other places.

[FN#321] The word is the Heb. ""Hagg"" whose primary meaning is circularity of form or movement. Hence it applied to religious festivals in which dancing round the idol played a prime part; and Lucian of ""saltation"" says, dancing was from the beginning and coeval with the ancient god, Love. But man danced with joy before he worshipped, and, when he invented a systematic saltation, he made it represent two things, and only two things, love and war, in most primitive form, courtship and fighting.

[FN#322] Two adjoining ground-waves in Meccah. For these and for the places subsequently mentioned the curious will consult my Pilgrimage, iii. 226, etc.

[FN#323] The 'Umrah or lesser Pilgrimage, I have noted, is the ceremony performed in Meccah at any time out of the pilgrim-season proper, i.e. between the eighth and tenth days of the twelfth lunar month Zu 'l-Hijjah. It does not entitle the Moslem to be called Hájj (pilgrim) or Hájí as Persians and Indians corrupt the word.

[FN#324] I need hardly note that Mohammed borrowed his pilgrimage-practices from the pagan Arabs who, centuries before his day, danced around the Meccan Ka'abah. Nor can he be blamed for having perpetuated a Gentile rite, if indeed it be true that the Ka'abah contained relics of Abraham and Ishmael.

[FN#325] On first sighting Meccah. See Night xci.

[FN#326] Arab. ""Tawáf:"" the place is called Matáf and the guide Mutawwif. (Pilgrimage, iii. 193, 205.) The seven courses are termed Ashwát.

[FN#327] Stoning the Devil at Mina. (Pilgrimage, iii. 282.) Hence
Satan's title ""the Stoned"" (lapidated not castrated).

[FN#328] Koran viii. 66; in the chapter entided ""Spoil,"" and relating mainly to the ""day of Al-Bedr.

[FN#329] Arab. ""AI-Ikálah""= cancelling: Mr. Payne uses the technical term ""resiliation.""

[FN#330] Freedman of Abdallah, son of the Caliph Omar and noted as a traditionist.

[FN#331] i.e. at a profit: the exchange must be equal—an ordinance intended to protect the poor. Arabs have strange prejudices in these matters; for instance it disgraces a Badawi to take money for milk.

[FN#332] Arab. ""Jamá'ah,"" which in theology means the Greek , our ""Church,"" the congregation of the Faithful under a lawful head. Hence the Sunnis call themselves ""People of the Sunnat and Jamá'at."" In the text it is explained as ""Ulfat"" or intimacy.

[FN#333] Arab. ""Al-Khalíl,"" i.e. of Allah=Abraham. Mohammed, following Jewish tradition, made Abraham rank second amongst the Prophets, inferior only to himself and superior to Hazrat Isa=Jesus. I have noted that Ishmael the elder son succeeded his father. He married Da'alah bint Muzáz bin Omar, a Jurhamite, and his progeny abandoning Hebrew began to speak Arabic (ta'arraba); hence called Muta'arribah or Arabised Arabs. (Pilgrimage iii. 190.) He died at Meccah and was buried with his mother in the space North of the Ka'abah called Al-Hijr which our writers continue to confuse with the city Al-Hijr. (Ibid. 165-66.)

[FN#334] This ejaculation, ""In the name of Allah"" is, I have noted, equivalent to ""saying grace."" If neglected it is a sin and entails a curse.

[FN#335] The ceremonious posture is sitting upon the shin-bones, not tailor-fashion; and ""bolting food"" is a sign of boorishness.

[FN#336] Arab. ""Zidd,"" the word is a fair specimen of Arabic ambiguity meaning primarily opposite or contrary (as virtue to vice), secondarily an enemy or a friend (as being opposite to an enemy).

[FN#337] ""The whole earth (shall be) but His handful on the Resurrection day and in His right hand shall the Heaven be rolled up (or folded together).""-Koran xxxix. 67.

[FN#338] See Night lxxxi.

[FN#339] Koran lxxviii. 19.

[FN#340] Arab. ""Al-Munáfik,"" technically meaning one who outwardly professes Al-Islam while inwardly hating it. Thus the word is by no means synonymous with our ""hypocrite,"" hypocrisy being the homage vice pays to virtue; a homage, I may observe, nowhere rendered more fulsomely than among the so-called Anglo-Saxon race.

[FN#341] Arab. ""Tawakkul alá 'llah"": in the imperative the phrase is vulgarly used=""Be off!""

[FN#342] i.e. ceremonial impurity which is sui generis, a very different thing from general dirtiness.

[FN#343] A thick beard is one which does not show the skin; otherwise the wearer is a ""Kausaj;"" in Pers. ""Kúseh."" See vol. iii., 246.

[FN#344] Arab. ""Al-Khutnah."" Nowhere commanded in the Koran and being only a practice of the Prophet, the rite is not indispensable for converts, especially the aged and the sick. Our ideas upon the subject are very hazy, for modern ""niceness"" allows a ""Feast of the Circumcision,"" but no discussion thereon. Moses (alias Osarsiph) borrowed the rite from the Egyptian hierophants who were all thus ""purified""; the object being to counteract the over-sensibility of the ""sixth sense"" and to harden the glans against abrasions and infection by exposure to air and friction against the dress. Almost all African tribes practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious: I shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al-Salkh (the flaying) still practised in the Arabian province Al-Asír. (Pilgrimage iii. 80.) There is a difference too between the Hebrew and the Moslem rite. The Jewish operator, after snipping off the foreskin, rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb-nails so that the external cutis does not retract far from the internal; and the wound, when healed, shows a narrow ring of cicatrice. This ripping is not done by Moslems. They use a stick as a probe passed round between glans and prepuce to ascertain the extent of the frenum and that there is no abnormal adhesion. The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the forceps, a fork of two bamboo splints, five or six inches long by a quarter thick, or in some cases an iron like our compasses. This is tied tightly over the foreskin so as to exclude about an inch and a half of the prepuce above and three quarters below. A single stroke of the razor drawn directly downwards removes the skin. The slight bleeding is stopped by burnt rags or ashes and healed with cerates, pledgets and fumigations. Thus Moslem circumcision does not prevent the skin retracting.

[FN#345] Of these 6336 versets only some 200 treat on law, civil and ceremonial, fiscal and political, devotional and ceremonial, canonical and ecclesiastical.

[FN#346] The learned young woman omitted Ukhnúkh=Enoch, because not in Koran; and if she denoted him by ""Idrís,"" the latter is much out of place.


[FN#347] Some say grandson of Shem. (Koran vii. 71.)

[FN#348] Koran vii. 63, etc.

[FN#349] Father-in-law of Moses. (Koran vii. 83.)

[FN#350] Who is the last and greatest of the twenty-five.

[FN#351] See Night ccccxxxviii.

[FN#352] Koran ii., whose 256th Ayah is the far-famed and sublime Throne-verse which begins ""Allah! there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal One, whom nor slumber nor sleep seizeth on!"" The trivial name is taken from the last line, ""His throne overstretcheth Heaven and Earth and to Him their preservation is no burden for He is the most Highest, the Supreme."" The lines are often repeated in prayers and engraved on agates, etc., as portable talismans.

[FN#353] Koran ii. 159.

[FN#354] Koran xvi. 92. The verset ends with, ""He warneth you, so haply ye may be mindful.""

[FN#355] Koran lxx. 38.

[FN#356] Koran xxxix. 54.
[FN#357] The Sunnis hold that the ""Anbiyá"" (=prophets, or rather announcers of Allah's judgments) were not sinless. But this dogma is branded as most irreverent and sinful by the Shi'ahs or Persian ""followers of Ali,"" who make capital out of this blasphemy and declare that if any prophet sinned he sinned only against himself.


[FN#358] Koran xii. 18.

[FN#359] Koran ii. 107.

[FN#360] Koran ii. 57. He (Allah) does not use the plurale majestatis.

[FN#361] Koran ii. 28.

[FN#362] Koran xvi. 100. Satan is stoned in the Miná or Muná basin (Night ccccxlii.) because he tempted Abraham to disobey the command of Allah by refusing to sacrifice Ishmael. (Pilgrimage iii. 248.)

[FN#363] It may also mean ""have recourse to God.""

[FN#364] Abdallah ibn Abbas, before noticed, first cousin of
Mohammed and the most learned of the Companions. See D'Herbelot.

[FN#365] Koran xcvi., ""Blood-clots,"" 1 and 2. ""Read"" may mean ""peruse the revelation"" (it was the first Koranic chapter communicated to Mohammed), or ""recite, preach.""

[FN#366] Koran xxvii. 30. Mr. Rodwell (p.1) holds to the old idea that the ""Basmalah"" is of Jewish origin, taught to the Kuraysh by Omayyah, of Taif, the poet and Haníf (convert).

[FN#367] Koran ix.: this was the last chapter revealed and the only one revealed entire except verse 110.

[FN#368] Ali was despatched from Al-Medinah to Meccah by the Prophet on his own slit-eared camel to promulgate this chapter; and meeting the assembly at Al-'Akabah he also acquainted them with four things; (1) No Infidel may approach the Meccah temple; (2) naked men must no longer circut the Ka'abah; (3) only Moslems enter Paradise, and (4) public faith must be kept.

[FN#369] Dictionaries give the word ""Basmalah"" (=saying
Bismillah); but the common pronunciation is ""Bismalah.""

[FN#370] Koran xvii. 110, a passage revealed because the Infidels, hearing Mohammed calling upon The Compassionate, imagined that Al-Rahmán was other deity but Allah. The ""names"" have two grand divisions, Asmá Jalálí, the fiery or terrible attributes, and the Asmá Jamálí (airy, watery, earthy or) amiable. Together they form the Asmá al-Husna or glorious attributes, and do not include the Ism al-A'azam, the ineffable name which is known only to a few.

[FN#371] Koran ii. 158.


[FN#372] Koran xcvi. before noticed.

[FN#373] A man of Al-Medinah, one of the first of Mohammed's disciples.

[FN#374] Koran lxxiv. 1, etc., supposed to have been addressed by Gabriel to Mohammed when in the cave of Hira or Jabal Núr. He returned to his wife Khadijah in sore terror at the vision of one sitting on a throne between heaven and earth, and bade her cover him up. Whereupon the Archangel descended with this text, supposed to be the first revealed. Mr. Rodwell (p. 3) renders it, ""O thou enwrapped in thy mantle!"" and makes it No. ii. after a Fatrah or silent interval of six months to three years.

[FN#375] There are several versets on this subject (chapts. ii. and xxx.)

[FN#376] Koran cx. 1.

[FN#377] The third Caliph; the ""Writer of the Koran.""

[FN#378] Koran, v. 4. Sale translates ""idols."" Mr. Rodwell, ""On the blocks (or shafts) of Stone,"" rude altars set by the pagan Arabs before their dwellings.

[FN#379] Koran, v. 116. The words are put into the mouth of
Jesus.

[FN#380] The end of the same verse.

[FN#381] Koran, v. 89. Supposed to have been revealed when certain Moslems purposed to practise Christian asceticism, fasting, watching, abstaining from women and sleeping on hard beds. I have said Mohammed would have ""no monkery in Al-Islam,"" but human nature willed otherwise. Mr. Rodwell prefers ""Interdict the healthful viands.""

[FN#382] Koran, iv. 124.

[FN#383] Arab. ""Mukri."" ""Kári"" is one who reads the Koran to pupils; the Mukri corrects them. ""With the passage of the clouds"" = without a moment's hesitation.

[FN#384] The twenty-first, twenty-fourth and eighteenth Arabic letters.

[FN#385] Arab. ""Hizb."" The Koran is divided into sixty portions, answering to ""Lessons"" for convenience of public worship.

[FN#386] Arab. ""Jalálah,""=saying Jalla Jalálu-hu=magnified be His
Majesty!, or glorified be His Glory.

[FN#387] Koran, xi. 50.

[FN#388] The partition-wall between Heaven and Hell which others call Al-'Urf (in the sing. from the verb meaning he separated or parted). The Jews borrowed from the Guebres the idea of a partition between Heaven and Hell and made it so thin that the blessed and damned can speak together. There is much dispute about the population of Al-A'aráf, the general idea being that they are men who do not deserve reward in Heaven or punishment in Hell. But it is not a ""Purgatory"" or place of expiating sins.

[FN#389] Koran, vii. 154.

[FN#390] A play on the word ayn, which means ""eye"" or the eighteenth letter which in olden times had the form of a circle.

[FN#391] From misreading these words comes the absurd popular belief of the moon passing up and down Mohammed's sleeves. George B. Airy (The Athenæum, Nov.29, 1884) justly objects to Sale's translation ""The hour of judgment approacheth"" and translates ""The moon hath been dichotomised"" a well-known astronomical term when the light portion of the moon is defined in a strait line: in other words when it is really a half-moon at the first and third quarters of each lunation. Others understand, The moon shall be split on the Last Day, the preterite for the future in prophetic style. ""Koran Moslems"" of course understand it literally.

[FN#392] Chapters liv., lv. and lvi.



[FN#393] We should say, not to utter, etc.

[FN#394] These well-known ""humours of Hippocrates,"" which reappear in the form of temperaments of European phrenology, are still the base of Eastern therapeutics.

[FN#395] The doctrine of the three souls will be intelligible to
Spiritualists.

[FN#396] Arab. ""Al-lámi""=the l-shaped, curved, forked.

[FN#397] Arab. ""Usus,"" our os sacrum because, being incorruptible, the body will be built up thereon for Resurrection-time. Hence Hudibras sings (iii. 2),

""The learned Rabbis of the Jews
Write there's a bone which they call leuz,
I' the rump of man, etc.""

It is the Heb. ""Uz,"" whence older scholars derived os. Sale (sect. iv.) called it ""El Ajb, os coccygis or rump-bone.""
[FN#398] Arab physiologists had difficulties in procuring ""subjects""; and usually practised dissection on the simiads. Their illustrated books are droll; the figures have been copied and recopied till they have lost all resemblance to the originals.

[FN#399] The liver and spleen are held to be congealed blood.
Hence the couplet,

""We are allowed two carrions (i.e. with throats uncut) and
two bloods,
The fish and the locust, the liver and the spleen.""
(Pilgrimage iii. 92.)

[FN#400] This is perfectly true and yet little known to the general.

[FN#401] Koran xvii. 39.

[FN#402] Arab. ""Al-malikhulíya,"" proving that the Greeks then pronounced the penultimate vowel according to the acute accentía; not as we slur it over. In old Hebrew we have the transliteration of four Greek words; in the languages of Hindostan many scores including names of places; and in Latin and Arabic as many hundreds. By a scholar-like comparison of these remains we should find little difficulty in establishing the true Greek pronunciation since the days of Alexander the Great; and we shall prove that it was pronounced according to accent and emphatically not quantity. In the next century I presume English boys will be taught to pronounce Greek as the Greeks do.

[FN#403] Educated Arabs can quote many a verse bearing upon domestic medicine and reminding us of the lines bequeathed to Europe by the School of Salerno. Such e.g. are;

""After the noon-meal, sleep, although for moments twain;
After the night-meal, walk, though but two steps be ta'en;
And after swiving stale, though but two drops thou drain.""

[FN#404] Arab. ""Sarídah"" (Tharídah), also called ""ghaut""=crumbled bread and hashed meat in broth; or bread, milk and meat. The Sarídah of Ghassán, cooked with eggs and marrow, was held a dainty dish: hence the Prophet's dictum.

[FN#405] Koran v. 92. ""Lots""=games of chance and ""images""=statues.

[FN#406] Koran ii. 216. The word ""Maysar"" which I have rendered ""gambling"" or gaming (for such is the modern application of the word), originally meant what St. Jerome calls and explains thereby the verse (Ezek. xxi. 22), ""The King held in his hand the lot of Jerusalem"" i.e. the arrow whereon the city-name was written. The Arabs use it for casting lots with ten azlam or headless arrows (for dice) three being blanks and the rest notched from one to seven. They were thrown by a ""Zárib"" or punter and the stake was generally a camel. Amongst so excitable a people as the Arabs, this game caused quarrels and bloodshed, hence its prohibition: and the theologians, who everywhere and at all times delight in burdening human nature, have extended the command, which is rather admonitory than prohibitive, to all games of chance. Tarafah is supposed to allude to this practice in his Mu'allakah.

[FN#407] Liberal Moslems observe that the Koranic prohibition is not absolute, with threat of Hell for infraction. Yet Mohammed doubtless forbade all inebriatives and the occasion of his so doing is well known. (Pilgrimage ii. 322.)

[FN#408] I have noticed this soured milk in Pilgrimage i. 362.

[FN#409] He does not say the ""Caliph"" or successor of his uncle
Mohammed.

[FN#410] The Jewish Korah (Numbers xvi.) fabled by the Koran (xxviii. 76), following a Talmudic tradition, to have been a man of immense wealth. The notion that lying with an old woman, after the menses have ceased, is unwholesome, dates from great antiquity; and the benefits of the reverse process were well known to good King David. The faces of children who sleep with their grandparents (a bad practice now waxing obsolete in England), of a young wife married to an old man and of a young man married to an old woman, show a peculiar wizened appearance, a look of age overlaying youth which cannot be mistaken.

[FN#411] Arab. ""Hindibá""(=endubium): the modern term is
Shakuríyah=chicorée. I believe it to be very hurtful to the eyes.

[FN#412] Arab. ""Khuffásh"" and ""Watwát"": in Egypt a woman is called ""Watwátíyah"" when the hair of her privities has been removed by applying bats' blood. I have often heard of this; but cannot understand how such an application can act depilatory.

[FN#413] Dictionaries render the word by ""dragon, cockatrice."" The Badawin apply it to a variety of serpents mostly large and all considered venomous.

[FN#414] Arab. ""Zarr wa 'urwah,"" 1it.=handle. The button-hole, I have said, is a modern invention; Urwah is also applied to the loopshaped handle of the water-skin, for attachment of the Allákah or suspensory thong.

[FN#415] Koran lxx. 40; see also the chapter following, v. 16.

[FN#416] Koran x. 5; the ""her"" refers to the sun.

[FN#417] Koran xxxvi. 40.

[FN#418] Koran xxii. 60.

[FN#419] Arab. ""Manázil:"" these are the Hindu ""Nakshatra""; extensively used in meteorology even by Europeans unconsciously: thus they will speak of the Elephantina-storm without knowing anything of the lunar mansion so called. The names in the text are successively Sharatán=two horns of the Ram; (2) the Ram's belly; (3) the Pleiades; (4) Aldebaran; (5) three stars in Orion's head; (6) ditto in Orion's shoulder; (7) two stars above the Twins; (8) Lion's nose and first summer station; (9) Lion's eye; (1O) Lion's forehead; (11) Lion's mane; (12) Lion's heart; (13) the Dog, two stars in Virgo; (14) Spica Virginis; (15) foot of Virgo; (16) horns of Scorpio; (17) the Crown; (18) heart of Scorpio; (19) tail of Scorpio; (2O) stars in Pegasus; (21) where no constellation appears; (22) the Slaughterer's luck; (23) Glutton's luck; (24) Luck of Lucks, stars in Aquarius; (25) Luck of Tents, stars in Aquarius; (26) the fore-lip or spout of Urn; (27) hind lip of Urn; and (28) in navel of Fish's belly (Batn al-Hút); of these 28, to each of the four seasons 7 are allotted.

[FN#420] The Hebrew absey, still used by Moslems in chronograms. For mnemonic purposes the 28 letters are distributed into eight words of which the first and second are Abjad and Hawwaz. The last six letters in two words (Thakhiz and Zuzigh) are Arabian, unknown to the Jews and not found in Syriac.

[FN#421] Arab. ""Zindík;"" properly, one who believes in two gods (the old Persian dualism); in books an atheist, i.e. one who does not believe in a god or gods; and, popularly, a free-thinker who denies the existence of a Supreme Being, rejects revelation for the laws of Nature imprinted on the heart of man and for humanity in its widest sense. Hence he is accused of permitting incestuous marriages and other abominations. We should now call him (for want of something better) an Agnostic.

[FN#422] Koran xxxi. 34. The words may still be applied to meteorologists especially of the scientific school. Even the experienced (as the followers of the late Mathieu de la Drôme) reckon far more failures than successes. The Koranic passage enumerates five things known only to Allah; Judgment-day; rain; sex of child in womb; what shall happen to-morrow and where a man shall die.

[FN#423] The fifth and seventh months (January and March) of the Coptic year which, being solar, is still used by Arab and Egyptian meteorologists. Much information thereon will be found in the ""Egyptian Calendar"" by Mr. Mitchell, Alexandria, 1876. It bears the appropriate motto ""Anni certus modus apud solos semper Egyptios fuit."" (Macrobius.) See also Lane M.E., chapt. ix.

[FN#424] Vulg. Kiyák; the fourth month, beginning 9th—1Oth
December. The first month is Tút, commencing 1Oth—11th
September.

[FN#425] The 8th and 12th months partly corresponding with April and August: Hátúr is the 3rd (November) and AmshRr the 6th (February).

[FN#426] Moslems have been compelled to adopt infidel names for the months because Mohammed's Koranic rejection of Nasy or intercalation makes their lunar months describe the whole circle of the seasons in a cycle of about thirty-three and a half years. Yet they have retained the terms which contain the original motive of the denomination. The first month is Muharram, the ""Holy,"" because war was forbidden; it was also known as Safar No. 1. The second Safar=""Emptiness,"" because during the heats citizens left the towns and retired to Táif and other cool sites. Rabí'a (first and second) alluded to the spring-pasturages; Jumádá (first and second) to the ""hardening"" of the dry ground and, according to some, to the solidification, freezing, of the water in the highlands. Rajab (No.7)=""worshipping,"" especially by sacrifice, is also known as Al-Asamm the deaf; because being sacred, the rattle of arms was unheard. Sha'abán=""collecting,"" dispersing, ruining, because the tribal wars recommenced: Ramazan (intensely hot) has been explained and Shawwál (No. 10) derives from Shaul (elevating) when the he-camels raise their tails in rut. Zú'l-Ka'adah, the sedentary, is the rest time of the year, when fighting is forbidden and Zu'l-Hijjah explains itself as the pilgrimage-month.
[FN#427] The lowest of the seven.
[FN#428] Koran xxxvii. 5.
[FN#429] Arab. ""Faylasúf,"" an evident corruption from the Greek. Amongst the vulgar it denotes a sceptic, an atheist; much the same a ""Frammásún"" or Freemason. The curious reader will consult the Dabistan, vol. iii. chapt. xi. p. 138 et seq. ""On the Religion of the Wise"" (philosophi), and, Beaconsfield's theft from Shaftesbury.

[FN#430] Koran xxxvi. 37-38.

[FN#431] Koran xxii. 7. The Hour i.e. of Judgment.

[FN#432] Koran xx. 58. The Midrasch Tanchumah on Exod. vii. gives a similar dialogue between Pharaoh and Moses. (Rodwell, in loco.)

[FN#433] Arab. ""Sham'ún"" or ""Shim'ún,"" usually applied to Simon
Peter (as in Acts xv. 14). But the text alludes to Saint Simeon
(Luke ii. 25-35). See Gospel of Infancy (ii. 8) and especially
the Gospel of Nicodemus (xii. 3) which makes him a High-Priest.

[FN#434] Sálih the Patriarch's she-camel, miraculously produced from the rock in order to convert the Thamúd-tribe. (Koran vii.)

[FN#435] When Abu Bakr was hiding with Mohammed in a cave on the Hill Al-Saur (Thaur or Thúr, Pilgrimage ii. 131) South of Meccah, which must not be confounded with the cave on Jabal Hirá now called Jabal Núr on the way to Arafat (Pilgrimage iii. 246), the fugitives were protected by a bird which built her nest at the entrance (according to another legend it was curtained by a spider's web), whilst another bird (the crow of whom I shall presently speak) tried to betray them. The first bird is popularly supposed to have been a pigeon, and is referred to by Hudibras,

""Th' apostles of this fierce religion
Like Mahomet, were ass and widgeon.""

The ass I presume alludes to the marvellous beast Al-Burák which the Greeks called from (Euthymius in Pocock, Spec. A.H. p.144) and which Indian Moslems picture with human face, ass's ears, equine body and peacock's wings and tail. The ""widgeon"" I presume to be a mistake or a misprint for pigeon.

[FN#436] The Arabs are not satisfied with the comparative moderation of the Hebrew miracle, and have added all manner of absurdities. (Pilgrimage ii. 288.)

[FN#437] Koran lxxxi. 18. Sale translates ""by the morning when it appeareth;"" and the word (tanaffus) will bear this meaning. Mr. Rodwell prefers, ""By the dawn when it clears away the darkness by its breath.""

[FN#438] As a rule Moslems are absurdly ignorant of arithmetic and apparently cannot master it. Hence in Egypt they used Copts for calculating-machines and further East Hindds. The mildest numerical puzzle, like the above, is sure of success.

[FN#439] The paradiseal tree which supplied every want. Mohammed borrowed it from the Christians (Rev. xxi. 10-21 and xxii. 1-2) who placed in their paradise the Tree of Life which bears twelve sorts of fruits and leaves of healing virtue. (See also the 3rd book of Hermas, his Similitudes.) The Hebrews borrowed it from the Persians. Amongst the Hindus it appears as ""Kalpavriksha;"" amongst the Scandinavians as Yggdrasil. The curious reader will consult Mr. James Fergusson's learned work, ""Tree and Serpent Worship,"" etc. London, 1873.

[FN#440] Aaron's Rod becomes amongst Moslems (Koran vii. 110) Moses' Staff; the size being that of a top-mast. (Pilgrimage i. 300, 301.) In Koran xx. 18, 19, we find a notice of its uses; and during the Middle Ages it reappeared in the Staff of Wamba the Goth (A.D.672-680) the witch's broomstick was its latest development.

[FN#441] Christ, say the Eutychians, had only one nature, the divine; so he was crucified in effigy.

[FN#442] Jesus is compared with Adam in the Koran (chapt. iii.): his titles are Kalámu 'llah (word of God) because engendered without a father, and Rúhu 'llah (breath of God) because conceived by Gabriel in the shape of a beautifui youth breathing into the Virgin's vulva. Hence Moslems believe in a ""miraculous conception"" and consequently determine that one so conceived was, like Elias and Khizr, not subject to death; they also hold him born free from ""original sin"" (a most sinful superstition), a veil being placed before the Virgin and Child against the Evil One who could not touch them. He spoke when a babe in cradle; he performed miracles of physic; he was taken up to Heaven; he will appear as the forerunner of Mohammed on the White Tower of Damascus, and finally he will be buried at Al-Medinah. The Jews on the other hand speak of him as ""that man:"" they hold that he was begotten by Joseph during the menstrual period and therefore a born magician. Moreover he learned the Sham ha-maphrash or Nomen tetragrammaton, wrote it on parchment and placed it in an incision in his thigh, which closed up on the Name being mentioned (Buxtorf, Lex Talmud, 25-41). Other details are given in the Toldoth Jesu (Historia Joshuæ Nazareni). This note should be read by the eminent English littérateur who discovered a fact, well known to Locke and Carlyle, that ""Mohammedans are Christians."" So they are and something more.
[FN#443] In the Kalamdán, or pen-case, is a little inkstand of metal occupying the top of the long, narrow box.

[FN#444] A fair specimen of the riddle known as the ""surprise.""

[FN#445] Koran xli. 10.

[FN#446] Koran xxxvi. 82.

[FN#447] Here we enter upon a series of disputed points. The Wahhábis deny the intercession of the Apostle (Pilgrimage ii. 76-77). The Shi'ahs place Ali next in dignity to Mohammed and there is a sect (Ali-Iláhi) which believes him to be an Avatar or incarnation of the Deity. For the latter the curious reader will consult the ""Dabistan,"" ii. 451. The Koran by its many contradictions seems to show that Mohammed never could make up his own mind on the subject, thinking himself at times an intercessor and then sharply denying all intercession.

[FN#448] Arab. ""Kanjifah""=a pack of cards; corrupted from the Persian ""Ganjífah."" We know little concerning the date or origin of this game in the East, where the packs are quite unlike ours.

[FN#449] It is interesting to compare this account with the pseudo Ovid and with Tale clxvi. in Gesta ""Of the game of Schaci."" Its Schacarium is the chess-board. Rochus (roccus, etc.) is not from the Germ. Rock (a coat) but from Rukh (Pers. a hero, a knight-errant) Alphinus (Ital. Alfino) is Al-Firzán (Pers. science, wise).

[FN#450] Arab, ""Baydak"" or ""Bayzak""; a corruption of the Persian ""Piyádah""=a footman, peon, pawn; and proving whence the Arabs derived the game. The Persians are the readiest backgammon-players known to me, better even than the Greeks; they throw the dice from the hand and continue foully abusing the fathers and mothers of the ""bones"" whilst the game lasts. It is often played in the intervals of dinner by the higher classes in Persia.

[FN#451] Metaphor from loading camels and mules. To ""eat"" a piece is to take it.

[FN#452] Arab. ""Bilábil""; a plural of ""Bulbul"" with a double entendre balábil (plur. of ballalah)=heart's troubles, and ""balá, bul""=a calamity, nay, etc.Embed"

[Verse 1: Sam Haft]
They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me ""no""
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Haft]
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain

[Chorus: Sam Haft]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
You might also like[Verse 2: Sam Haft]
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I’m so humble, I say I'm turning red
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Haft]
Can you heal me, have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain

[Chorus: Sam Haft]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
[Outro: Sam Haft]
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind (Yeah)
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (Left behind)
World is below
So high up, I'm near divine (I'm so high up)
Lean in, let go

I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I've been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

ज्वाला ज्वाला ज्वाला छोटे लाया मैं game में
Dollar Dollar Dollar छोटे लाया मैं game में
बड़ा नाम नाम बनाया मैं game में
लिया नहीं चैन तब तो
हीरा है chain में
लिखता था गली में
अब भी लिखता हूँ plane में
असल ज़िन्दगी है मेरी छोटे no entertainment
इतिहास लिख दिया
तुझे classics दिया
5X Plat (platinum)
गली  वाले ने दिया
पीछे से आके फिर सामने से दिया
Sachin का bat बम्बई का मैंने नाम रख दिया जब studio में locked तब सब खोल दिया
अगर दो मैन लिए तो दस मैंने दिया
उसने दस मुझसे लेकर डस मुझे दिया
Roll करके पहले सबको कश मैंने दिया
बादलों के ऊपर मैंने game रख दिया
Quality गानों से make it rain कर दिया
बस बस हो गया अभी सिर्फ परिवार मेरा
पहले शनि था अब हर दिन शनिवार मेरा
Dentist से ज़्यादा मुझे game दाँत दे रहा
Vaccine ये bars और मैं सबको shot दे रहा
मुझे game साथ दे रहा जैसे लिया मैंने सात फेरा
सिर्फ मैं जानता हू पुण्य पाप मेरा
दिमाग को रखते दूसरा और ख्वाब पहला
कलम से bar fest Pentecost मेरा
अगर मालूम तू जीता चल हाथ ऊपर कर
दिल से सलाम हाँ मेरा साथ दे अगर
गहरा पानी बोलके मेरे साथ थे मगर
भगवान् मुझे बोला DIVINE पानी पे चल
Yeezus वाले mode में
नस वाले mode में
खून से बेहतर कोई नहीं शख्स वाले mode में
गन्दगी है तू और में flush वाले mode में
सीखा सब road पे और में सौ-सौ था board में

हम खोलेंगे जैसे खो-खो का game
तू बाहर दीखता अच्छा सिर्फ promo का game
रखता चार मेरे साथ जैसे दो-दो का game
तू और तेरे homie छोटे दोनों का game
छुट्टा पैसा रख के देख लाया न change
रख तेरा fame
मैं बन्दा नहीं same

घर के बहार तेरे पहुंचे रंगोली वाला shot

Edit करके तूने image मेरा meme बना दिया
मेहनत करके तेरे भाई ने पूरा dream बना दिया
Picture या सड़कों पे scene बना दिया
खुदका time लाया मैंने सबसे बड़ा गाना दिया
शिक्षक से पहले thugs देखा
Tiffin box से पहले मैंने drugs देखा
उन्नतीस साल का मैं पर लगता मैंने सब देखा
रिश्तों में प्यार से ज़्यादा शक देखा
शौहरत के लिए ज़्यादा मेहनत थोड़ा luck देखा
Circle रखता tight और मैं circle जितना Fuck देता
नशा अपन करते इसलिए नशे में न रख देता
ना ना ज़िन्दगी तमाशा है
Views तो sixty nine को भी आता है
अपना missionary shot सब कुछ सामने से जाता है
Bank मेरा घर का खुदका मेरा खाता है
License पे है album क्यूंकि maths मुझे आता है
Dollar जब involved तब cents समझ आता है
जब bills और passion दोनों साथ में नहीं जाता है
जो passion न दे पैसे वो passion नहीं सिखाता है?
Independent मैं नहीं सिर्फ entertainment में
Independent मैं हूँ हर street के pavement पे
इनके बाप के payment से आया lame men के साथ
नज़रें तो मिलाना कभी real men के साथ
मैं करते रहूँगा grind जब तक छे men दे हाथ
सब कुछ अपन risk करते
टूटता तारा दिखे, तो अभी भी हम wish करते
ज्ञान लिया नानी से हाँ, अभी भी हम miss करते
आसमान को देख कर अभी भी हम kiss करते

He do the Twork Bounce and stop with a Glock pop
Leg pop, he'll go from hopping to hopscotch

I can throw him in the creek or I can lake fam'
Or he gets sunk in the middle of the gulf like Space Jam
You can't come around my way fam', you gon' need ya heat
I mean we both from Jersey but I'm really from the meaner streets
You from the other side, beautiful, grass cut, trees and leafs
I'm from the block, we had pills, coke, weed and lean
No time to even eat
I'm talkin' peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and then it's back to feed the streets
No time for Roscoes Chicken & Waffles, so we had to settle for P&B
This nigga ain't seein' me, that's pure nervousness
Up here spittin' all them words and shit
I get that wrap around and put a stop to that flow like a tourniquet
Burn this bitch, 12 left in the 30 clips
Still enough to pierce Singh (piercing) all over his body like some Xerxes shit
Merciless, it's petty killers that I'm workin' with
I charge 60, I give them 50, take my little paper off the top, it's a Hersey's Kiss
Burn this bitch, you don't know what I'm workin' with
If your mother knew the company I keep, she'd be worried sick (Sikh)
I don't wanna hurt that bitch, cause she still kept you
She grew you, raised you to be nice and strong, she had to meal prep you
Be a shame to tell her I gotta kill that dude
I don't wanna see her cryin'
Gotta give Rest In Peace to her son on her arm, I would feel bad too
Your mother's from India, she's used to Henna, she never thought she would've had to get a Real tattoo
Yeah I choke in battles sometimes, but I'm still that dude
Fans hate it when I take an L
I mean I come up here with 50% and y'all don't really take it well
But y'all don't stand the other 50%, just in case things get real
It's like 10% for tithes and offerings, or I'm goin' straight to Hell
5% for the tints cause I don't want my face revealed
25 for court fees or I'm gettin' placed in jail
That's why I keep the other 10% just in case I gotta pay my bail
Bitch I'll blaze a shell
Grab the shotgun and get to raisin' Hell
If you don't want the paper to read, ""Dead, 5'9"", South Asian Male"" you better take this L
Or I'll pistol whip you so hard your brain'll swell
Grab the sticks and beat this Real Sikh (sick) kid ass, bitch I'm Dave Chappelle
Blaze a shell, chopper shootin' at a rapid pace
They done booked you with ""Mr. Break The Country Down"" bad mistake
You must be on some Molly (Somalia) thinkin' shit's sweet (Swedan) until I grab the pole and (Poland) then mark (Denmark) him out, but that can wait (Kuwait)
He be up here spittin' at a rapid pace
""Y'all should lyrically fear me. I'll slide, pick and then roll
A blade from my hip will just go hit his occipital lobe.""
Nigga, we ain't even hearin' you clearly
I think you're a fake Dizaster (disaster), a conspiracy theory
I don't even let this weirdo get near me
Long range, great aim with the MAC
Headshot, it look like Mojo Jojo, you can see the nigga brain through is wrap
Jersey!
[Round 2: Real Sikh]
The guys dope
But he be makin' up words in his lines though
Remember he told Nitty, ""Land O Lakes, if I don't see nothin' but a (butter) stick, I'ma win by a big margin""
""Margarine"", it's kinda close, I don't know
Why bro?
You said ""margin"" instead of ""margarine"", you forgot the A.R., I won't
Die slow, eyes closed
I left him incapacitated
This the second reenactment of Kennedy's assassination
Hit ya head 'til we see half ya brain extend like it's elastic, wait
I don't know how I thought of that, must be a stretch of thee imagination
This how to be thorough
I'm on my Doctor Strange the way I walk through this round gon' be out of this world
No co-sign or applause, chrome .9 to ya thoughts
Shoot ya brain out ya skull, I won't mind it at all
No time for the talk, ya soul fly to the Lord
.45 to ya core, every bone by it is off
You're left so wide it'll fall
Right gon' slide when it's tore
Like a DJ at a wedding, I need both sides on the floor
This Jersey, I been reppin', but they think less of Sikh presence
Even Suge said I'ma get left in this settin'
What evidence you got he gon' win, quit guessin'
I'd ask for Proof if you know Suge but that'll be a Trick Trick question
Big Desert, close range, bring it for a word
Sound like y'all predictin' this battle, I'm leanin' towards Twork
The boy heard the Eagle and knew he a dead man
Kevin Hart/Don Cheadle, he heard the .50 and said, ""Damn!""
You know what shook his pride?
He was drunk and tried to look alive
Couldn't drive with his eyes wide open so he took a dive
Shit, after that accident you don't remember the same
I bet you with the roads you crash was Memory Lane
He got ejected out the window it was not a game
Doctors put a metal plate in his skull when they had to operate
Kodak Black could learn how to feed his girl from how ya body laid
Cause this bitch got flown out but gotta plate
He said, ""Of course I still walk by faith and sometimes I drive-by too""
Last time you drove by faith your car flipped five times too
You was barely alive in a hospital bed losin' the will to live but fans got you conscious again
The culture cheering you on is what dragged you out ya slump
All them years of clappin' in a coma and we had to clap you outta one
And still, we always chokin'
Seems like he lost his focus
I would've thought the moment his car was broken it would've gave him auto-motive
Y'all be knowin' he recycle bars and say 'em like they new
That's somethin' we ain't take a likin' too
Now he stopped reusin' lines cause the crash was gonna take that life from you
And his skull got a metal plate and those ain't recyclable
I hope this ain't the time you drop off after the second round
I've been talkin' to you too long let me address the crowd
Yo, raise ya hand if ya think Twork one of the best that's out
See, look in the eyes of all the people you've been lettin' down
Jersey

[Round 3: Nu Jerzey Twork]
This ya road to fate
I read your religion, Sikhism, front to back, made sure I made no mistakes
Y'all believe in the Golden Rules, to uphold ya faith
Now it's not about just eatin' Curry, you gotta actually do things to the Golden States
Like meditation, givin' back to others, makin' an honest livin' and amongst other things, always go through shit like a warrior and hold ya weight
My nigga I done survived shootings, stabbings, jail, and a wreck Sikh (anorexic), so that shit you said don't hold no weight
We got plans to come
I read your religion 'til my motherfuckin' hands was numb
I read Sikhism cause there's questions that I needed answers from
Your religion says, you can only carry a small knife but you be up here handlin' guns
Your religion prohibits you from gettin' intoxicated but I've personally seen this man get drunk
Your religion says you get fulfillment from the sunlight
But you lettin' Shine defeat you only did more damage done
Y'all believe in kesh, kangha, karha, kachhera, kirpan, those are the Five K's in the land that you from
The Five K's! And this nigga couldn't even handle ONE
This man is done, you doin' Sikhism big damage
We don't even know why you wearin' that turban, you Nick Cannon
It's just brandin', with each step, whoever the real Sikhs are, this nigga need a G check
I done seen your people oppressed many times, you ain't go out there and march in the street yet
I mean, nigga I'm a Christian, my God allow me to rep this P set
Now I ain't sayin' Jesus was all out there in the streets but at least he got his feet wet
I need my RESPECT
Y'all only clown me for chokin' issues
You had a classic with Pat Stay
30'd Danny Myers
You got your ass kicked by Shine, look how quick they go against you
Same shit Smack did wit' me, but y'all don't realize, I was battlin' four battles back-to-back, somethin' I said I wouldn't hold against you
Really I should've sat down after every battle like Yoshimitsu
I feel like I don't convince you, cause still a nigga broke, really I'm a joke
I gave you moment, after moment, after moment
First time you jump on cam' about me is when a nigga choke
But you know how many niggas I done smoked? How many tickets I done sold?
I stuck out like a nail in the wall or cause I had an image to uphold
The police shot at me, y'all didn't even send a nigga hopes
No nothin', you talkin' I'm fuckin' up ya bag, no dummy, if I'm fuckin' up your bag then nigga we both cruddy
I almost died, got in the car and felt the ghost coming
I'm in the gurney fucked up, spine done, spine fucked up
Hospital bills up to my neck wit' no money
You're a fuckin' millionaire and I had to make a fuckin' GoFundMe
Ain't nobody travel down that road for me
Y'all said y'all wrote to me but I ain't never get the message
Only nigga to come see me was DNA, and that wasn't the Eric I expected
That shit is reckless, but this is where my respect is
Cause I love you Smack, I don't hate this man
At heart I'm still a 19-year-old boy that you gave a chance
If it wasn't for the URL I'd still be out in the fuckin' streets, prolly dead and God had greater plans
So no matter what the fuck we go through you always gon' be my man
But after that interview with JayBlac, you couldn't even shake my hand!
I'm ragin' fam'

Hold on y'all let me get it back, let me get it back
I'm ragin' fam', ahhhh, hold on
Control your emotions, control your emotions, control your emotions
Bro just focus
Aight I'm back Sikh; scoliosis
Bro just coastin'
I had to talk to Smack, you had to give me one moment
Nigga you be on Instagram, pictures of Chris Brown and Drake
I'm like, ""This nigga got plenty stuff goin'""
This nigga said, ""Remy Ma tied my shoe!"" We don't give a fuck homie
Nigga, ya boots was tied all the way up, that's the only reason Remy jumped on it
If it ain't $40,000 or better than it's fuck haters
Hitman, NXT, Jerry Wess, a buncha nut chasers
Smack don't call my phone for nothin' but paper
Free Surf nigga
Jersey

[Round 3: Real Sikh]
Y'all remember when he did a fake choke with Geechi?
Then said, ""That's somethin' the old Twork'll do""
Then choked for two more years, I guess that old Twork is new (Nu)
Besides me that's somethin' the whole Jersey do
You right, free Surf, you even choked versus Tsu
You the kinda person to be amazin' vs me, and then choke versus Mook
Y'all keep callin' me a ""terrorist"" that's what I'm goin' to turn into
I taught myself how to make a bomb explode burnin' fumes
With the push of a button, so while the whole world in school, doin' homework on Zoom
I was remote learnin' too
I'ma fool versus who?
Yeah with Shine I felt worse I let y'all down
I let the mic issues get in my head, shit got 30'd by the crowd
But I fought through it, even though it wasn't workin' I was proud
Shit, if you was in my state you would've Jersey'd every round
You gotta reinvent ya style
The old one ain't better, hold it together, control all ya temper
Show 'em some effort, don't just fold under pressure
If the same way you live is the same way you die, you won't be remembered
Your homies should check ya
Like in the past no one told you to spar?
Unless that battle is close you don't even start
What good is havin' bars that are goin' over ya head if he can't get it through his head to be goin' over his bars?
And still...now he banned from the live streams cause he had three rounds and then choked
Y'all know he used to work at Dunkin' Donuts?
You gon' confirm it?

[Twork] Yeah I did

[Real Sikh]
Y'all know he used to work at Dunkin' Donuts?
That links down to this though
Cause he restricted to the app so when he ask Beas' 'bout the big shows
He back at the drive-thru cause Caffeine's out the window
Talkin' 'bout, ""Donuts is 99 cents. It's on a board when you get in line.""
His tall ass was behind the register and his forehead hit the side
The numbers were lopsided, when he turned around to fix the sign
That's when he said, ""I got it. Bigga .9!""
Talkin' 'bout, I'm strapped in and I'll clap you in a coma
Bitch you should be askin' if Smack and them want a donut
I'll wave it back and forth, I be practicin' hypnosis
So I can get him out that madness if I snap at any moment
Roc had to turn his head, he couldn't quite see you die
Well I ain't ya mothafuckin' brother, I wanna see the life leave ya eyes
I'll smack you in coma, my hand heavy as ya .9
I'll have doctors rushin' in, tryin' to guess if you survive
They ready to pull the plug unless you give a sign
You gon' have to do the Twork hands to tell 'em you alive
I'm on that Jersey shit, that goin' all out shit
Real Sikh, and I'm the problem that you want rounds wit'?
You supposed to put in work, but that's wrong now bitch
Cause you can't show up to work when you call out Sikh (sick)

Step on set, and they feel my energy
You could never step with Fighters to Z
Still the best and that is by any means
Saiyan running through my blood in my streams
So as a jit I slid with sticks for the green
Saying this and that, you just wanna be
He tried blasting, then I slid with a Beam
He get sent straight to Kami
If he wanna talk, that's the only one way he'll be sitting above me
He talk, he get flipped like Dudley's
Filled up with rage, go Ape, it gets ugly
Funny thinking that you could snuff me
Diffеrence from you and I - you can't touch me
Thе Blue Beam gon' blast, and Zeni gon' stack
And us back to back, it's disgusting

[Verse 2: Vegeta (BlvkDivmonds)]
Galick Gun on me, and I never tuck it
I blow a planet, sky high when I touch it
I turned my ego to something worth boasting
They act like me, but if I was on budget
We sold a planet like work in a Duffy
I land on earth, and your bitch wanna touch me
Got a few jits that follow me too
Say he gon' blast? I'm following through
When I step out in the drip, I'm on badman
You got a flow, and it came from the trash can
I take 'em out in an instant like trash man
Leaving these niggas on crutches in last stand, uh
Beam with me, nigga
That was your bitch, you seen me, lil' nigga
Oozaru tail, go Ape
Show 'em dead bodies, that's all that I make

Feel my lungs popping like a sprung sprocket
Turn these words of wisdom into sum profits
Silver tongue got him real far in his life
Benefit of wit, sharp as a knife
Said linguistics can bed this fit chick
She fetching this stick and barks when I like
She can get this whole Chakra tonight
Fox in the sheets and we're starting a fight
Claw marks can be left if I charge the right
Give me cheek, and you'll be the one to garner stripes
Wannabe heroes, you're hardly righteous
Box in the ring with the tarnished, blighted
Bunch of clones in Uzumaki's likeness
Go the whole hog like I'm Harley riding
Eyes on me with that Kakashi biting, hah!
That's a Beast that I can't be hyping

[Verse 4: Sasuke (954mari)]
That's a Beast that I can't be hyping
Dolo rolling, vigilante timing
Fighting gods, no Antichrist
But pray tell, boy, I actually wipe 'em
Between Kakashi and Uzumaki
I'm the Shadow Kage with the flashy fighting
Dash in between the big names like writing hyphens
My pen game is actually frightening
Orochimaru, I been on their neck
And I'm leaving a mark on the game with my imprint
I move more dope lines than a kingpin
Susanoo purp, cut, then we mince them
Naruto, Sasuke - GOATs that's twinning
Names go together like they codependent
City know, me and bro is kindred
And we run the top like Cole and Kendrick
Dancing with gods, we Jigen with demons
Ducking karma when I tango with evil
Red eye drawing blood, then he leaking
Red dot, would've thought it was measles
Eyes of Indra, got the evil eyes
No Zodiac, it help me see the signs
Check the stone tablet, read between the lines
Reaching new heights 'cause the tree divine
Kage level, you a punk to me
Kage level, I'mma slump his team
If you think you can fuck with me, you must be
In a Tsukuyomi, world of drunken dreams
All black whip flames - Amaterasu
Soon as I blink, change places and box you
I make an opp turn soft when I walk through
Been a problem, better watch who you talk to
[Verse 5: Luffy (Shwabadi) & Zoro (Ham Sandwich)]
Ay! Yuh! Yuh, yuh
Luffy and Zoro like Badi and Ham
Don't need the mission 'cause we shared a vision
I'm tryna be king, and he said ""I'm your man, bet!""
Know that I bring up the fam
Came out the Blue and I flipped me a Grand
Told bro to bring out the blick, but he tripled the sticks
I'm like, ""How you ain't run out of hands?""
I ain't running the hands, he get hit with the motherfucking blade first
And my shooter, he keeping the laser
Chop at his top, I ain't talking a razor
If I cut him, that shit ain't a taper
Walk with a Saber
Asura style, I got infinite bladeworks
See, I been this way since I came out the cradle
You testing my metal, you leaving disabled
OK, Haki designer, the colour supreme
Red on the jacket, I'm stacking the green
Lost in the sauce where I happen to be
Devil or not, drop his ass in the sea
Devil or not, we gon' drop 'em like Big Mom
Drop him like Kaido, kid got a big chop
Bury his body, his soul finna lift off
Switching to Fifth if he trying to meet god
Chopper on me, scratch man, no beatbox
Twitter talking, slap man's whole beak off
Give 'em all the backhand, they weak sauce
Kuro capping, you cats get declawed
If I swing at the ground, I might cut up the treetops
Green on my mind, I don't fuck with the cheap talk
Think they from Elbaf, I'm chopping their beanstalk
Shit that could kill you's the shit that I sleep off
[Verse 6: Todo (Delta Deez)]
Ay, look, litter man, I got the pick of it
Her ass fat, now I'm in the thick of it
They put my feet to the fire, what they get from it?
I'mma start heating shit up like a brick oven
Tell your gang run
Been this way since K-12, that's why the fuck
I'm grade one
I cry every time I turn somebody
To a stain, huh!
Ask what kind of hoes they like
And everybody playing dumb
Motherfuckers got no sense of taste
Soon as I clap, they see a flash
And now I'm all inside their space
I swing a left, I mink 'em right
I'm tryna knock 'em out his laces
I blocked my main and called my side
Yeah, I just made them hoes switch places
And my domain so spacious
I could probably fit some more graves in
Hard to kill
Push ups got me looking like I body build
To tell the truth, boring bitches
Get me hot as Habaneros
I'm in here, and shit start looking dark
Man, that's a common fear
Hands together, it look like I'm praying
Soon as I appear
Heavy hands, that mean when I hit 'em
It's too much to bare
Domain expands, and it sounds like
Applause all in the fucking air

[Verse 7: Itadori (954mari)]
Fuck the fair, hit blocks spinning like ferris
Ripping like ticket checks
Real is in my jeans, all y'all shit is just in distress
Y'all getting stretched
Hit the shrine, praying to myself
Worst half of me still been the best
Demon leaving me, it's like DND
Can't hear the calling of the bitter threats
Can't seem to sleep easily
My inner demons - my main problems
Air thick with blood, you can smell it coming
Like the Dirty South before the rain dropping
Special grades dropping, cut slackers for the
Fucking acquisition of an apparition piece
Magnetism, just attracting shit to me
Crossing paths is a blasphemy to me
How many Sorcerers can't even stand to me?
How many forces do you need to banish me?
How many stuck in a rut by the roots
When they should've climbed to the top like a canopy
How many horses in that black dodge
Demon that got the whip floating like Manatee
Domain expansion, the plan of attack
It's black flashes if you switch and abandon me

[Verse 8: Killua (DizzyEight) & Gon (Mix Williams)]
If he really want static, I'm shocking his body
And leaving him stiff
Inflating his head, he gon' end up dead
This target ain't easy to miss
Said he want smoke, gon' cough up a lung
You niggas don't give me the spliff
You been talking 'bout dynamic duos on top of the game
It's Dizzy and Mix!
Wait, it's Dizzy and Mix, and we in the mix
To show you on records there's levels to this
Hit after hit, we stuck in a loop
How we lapping these rappers again and again
I feel like Mahomes on the beat, see, the opps get to creeping
I'm peeping the blitz
I am convinced, you ain't got no grip on this shit
Y'all need to cease and desist
I put a crease in his clique
His crew get a feast from the clip
Look up, we raising the bar and ready to pull up
Jump shot, that's a pull up for real
We in the field, it can get real
Had to go steal on him
Caught him lacking with no steel on him, put a bill on him
For the right price, leave him still for 'em
Don't cross the homies, I would kill for 'em
Not aiming to please, I aim at the top
I got a hitlist, hear the click click
Keep your head on a swivel, your name at the top
You think he a demon, don't play with a god
My niggas don't play on the side
Niggas is fake, you stay in disguise
They was all hating, their bodies? You can't ever find!
Flow sick, no tuberculosis
My cadence potent, don't blur the focus
Fuck a post game, I ain't backing down
They was laughing at me, look who's laughing now
What's a real king with only half a crown?
No room at the top for yours and mines
I'm eating for real, what's yours is mines
And niggas be thinking it's sweet, so I get annoyed sometimes
When they in my scope
They going ghost, that's a poltergeist
I killed so many, my heart get a little too cold sometimes
Always playing like it's overtime
Always working like it's overtime
That's time and a half
If I'm on a mission to silence a nigga
Then cherish the time that you have, uh
But that didn't last, I was ready to blast on whoever
I might black on your pack, don't get turned to a pack
For a fruitless endeavor
Play with your life, and you'll lose it forever
Bury your body and bury the shovel
Uh, get rid of the evidence
Disappear like your relevance
It's evident, Dizzy is better than every competitor
Think he a beast 'till I prey on the predator
Better pray for the predator
Then it's a rap like sushi
Y'all all cap like Kufis
But that's old news like 2G
And me and Mix, that's two G's
If you want a verse, gotta double that
But y'all all jokes like Druski
Your girl tryna kick it like Bruce Lee
'Cause I'm from the boot like Tunechi
Now he tryna bark at me loosely
Get the deuce deuce, now his body two times three
Feet deep, send your fleet
Then this all repeat, send your fleet
Then they all deceased, came with numbers
And they all decreased, you do the mathEmbed"

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)

Gonna rock, gonna roll, we'll take control
But if ya' had to rock the mic, it's in the soul
In the heart, in the mind, it'll make you blind
It'll make the other rappers a drop a dime
Do you mind, huh, it can take you home
And teach you not to fess on the microphone

[MCA]
M-A-Z-I-N-G
I'm a messing on the mic at all the cool parties
I've been on the mic in Rome and Capri
And all the fine Italian women fell in love with me
Now Mike D's stroll, stealin' the show
I say, come on Mike D, let's flash some dough
On the go all of the time
When you're rappin' your rhyme, you know you ring my chime
And now he's the one who's gonna show you how to dance
The King Adrock don't give him a chance
When he starts to dance, the ladies gather around
The King Adrock, he's gonna get down
He'll bust the know how to do it to you
Just four fresh folks and we form a fresh crew
Adrock just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
You might also likeI say K-I-N-G A-D rock
You know the whole world is on my jock
I got girls after me on the T-I-P
And I will do it to you, and you know it's you I please
Cause I'm a man who needs no introduction
Got a big tool of reproduction
Bouncin' in your ears what you always wishin'
For the day to come when I start to dishin'
On your body and your mind
Just take a number, and get in line
Cause when I get you into bed, you know I'll soothe you
Then you'll know the real meaning of the Beastie groove
And now something new, a double-time cool rhyme
From my boy Adrock sendin' tickles up your spine
Suck on this, cause he rocks gritty
A B-E-A-S-T-I-E, well, everyone knows me
You know that I can surely be the number one in frequency
I'm hip, I'm hoppin', I tick and tock
For everyone that's on my jock
You know that I can surely rock
I like to talk, I take the time
Turn it in, I turn it out
Makin' rhymes, scream and shout
King of the mic, I rock
I know how to turn you on just like a light
I'm number one, and I'm the one
King Adrock of psycho to the last
Is the day of the Beastie groove
So bet the fly rhymes to make you move
Everybody in the world, whoever you are
You better get ready, DJ Double R, huh
That's right
Hey, hey, mama

[Mike D]
Just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
Well, I'll put it to you, I'm Mike D
I'm rappin' on the mic, a number one MC
Cause when I'm on the court, I put the ball in the hoop
I'll throw you ten bucks as I do the alley-oop
Just throw me the ball, and watch me get down
I'll take you for a sucker, and I'll throw you to the ground
Take that, if you think you can
Meet the floor and that to this here rap
Now you know you can bust that move
Everybody dance to the Beastie groove

[MCA]
Just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
Come on gorgeous, pretty, little, French fly girlie
See me standin' on the stage and wanna' tour around the world
If you wanna' see some more
When I'm not on the floor
Just come on back stage, and I'll tell you how to turn it
If you don't know what to do, I'll do it to you
Well, just take off your clothes and start the boogaloo
Now all the nice ladies
We'll all say please
""Please""
And they all know that's me
MCA makin' the party
With the ultimate rhymes from tip to bass
Just doin' those ladies all over the place
On the floor or in the back
I never do it wack
Just put 'em in a line, layin' on their back
And then I'll do them all, one at a time
MCA so loose with the rhyme
Ohh

You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax

""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed"

""Enjoy yourself -- every day above ground is a good day. - ANONYMOUS, MIAMI 1981

1 A PROLOGUE
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'

The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

Over this:

VOICE #1 (o.s.)
Okay so what do you call yourself?
VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?

MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?

VOICE #1
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?

MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...

VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?

MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...

VOICE #1
Mother?

TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?

TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....

VOICE #2
Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?

TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?

TONY
Me jail? No way.

We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.

MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?

TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.

MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?

TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?

MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.

The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.

TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.

MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?

TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.

His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.

MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?

TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)

MAN #3
And this?

He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.

TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.

MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?

TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.

TONY
Some Canadian tourist....

MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)

TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?

Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.

MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?

MAN #3
(walking out)
I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.

TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

Man #3 at the door stops, looks back.

TONY
Send me here, send me there. This.
That. Nothing you can do to me
Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

That taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the
immigration theme, we:

DISSOLVE TO
7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A
The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.

Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

MANNY
Seat's taken.

TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.

Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

TONY
So what'd you tell them?

MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.

TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

The bus pulling out now.

MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.

TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.

MANNY
Fuck you Tony....

TONY
You did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.

7-B EXT. MIAMI FROM BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT 7-B

DISSOLVE TO
8 INT. TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8

A movie projector...
...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.
Time to go to sleep.
(closes his eyes
but not for long)

CUT TO

9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9
Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.

TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!

TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....

He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.

TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.

MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.

TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.

MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....

TONY
I know.

MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.

TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!

MANNY
Yeah, sure.

TONY
Hey, c'mon.

Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.

CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.

MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.

CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.

MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....

CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---

MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?

CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.

MANNY
A real snatch?

CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.

As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""

He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.

He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

TRANSVESTITE
(passing)
What about you sugar -- you wanna party?

TONY
(passing her)
Yeah with whose cock, honey?

CUT TO

10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.

Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.

VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?

Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.

He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?

ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!

TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.

ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.

Manny catches up to Tony.

TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?

MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,

TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.

Angel comes over, listens.

MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!

TONY
Oh yeah?

MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.

TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.

MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.

ANGEL
Oh shit!

MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....

TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!

MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?

TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?

Tony winks and walks off.

The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.

TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'

CUT TO

11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER


Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.

TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....

The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.

MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!

Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.

ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?

TONY
I got better things to do.

ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?

TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?

(looking zd)
Let's walk.

They walk.

MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?

TONY
Yeah.

MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?

TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?

Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.

MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.

TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.

As Rebenga, in long-lensed closeup, nervously smokes a
cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.

CUT TO
13 MONTAGE - THE RIOT - FREEDOMTOWN - DAY

The visuals are swift, dispassionate and documentary-like.
The refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate,
carrying bricks and wooden slats.

ALL
(in unison)
Libertad! Libertad!

14 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND STATE POLICE
form ranks outside.

15 REFUGEES
flee through a hole in the fence.

16 GUARDS
move on them, wielding clubs.

17 SEVERAL REFUGEES
are scooting down a highway.

18 POLICE DOGS
on chains are glimpsed.

19 REFUGEES
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack.

20 REBENGA
a cigarette in his mouth, nervously hurries into a barrack.

21 ANGEL
tracks him, signals....

22 INSIDE - REFUGEES
are pulling apart their beds, going for the wooden slats.
Others set fire to their mattresses.

23 THE POLICE AND GUARDS
are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.

24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.

25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.

Manny runs up on him.

Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.

Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.

TONY
Rebenga!

Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.

TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!

The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.

...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.

26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.

DISSOLVE TO

27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER

An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.

It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.

End of montage. Music continues.

DISSOLVE TO

27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""

Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.

TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?

MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.

TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
Millionaire.

MANNY
How do you know?

TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.

MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...

A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.

TONY
Hey baby what you say?

She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....

TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.

TONY
Come on?

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.

Tony walks over to him, mocking.

TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.

MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....

As they walk off, backs to camera.

TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?

MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.

CUT TO
28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....

The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.

The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....

. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.

MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?

CUT TO

29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.

Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.

MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.

TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?

MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...

TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.

His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.

COOK
(Spanish)
Hey you two, outside! You got company...

MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!

TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....

CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....

Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.

OMAR
I got something for you.

MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?

OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.

MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.

TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?

Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.

TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.

MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...

TONY
Shaddup!

Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.

OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?

TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.

Steps forward. Manny grabs him.

MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....

In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.

OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.

WALDO
What about them Indians ---

The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.

OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?

TONY
You kidding.

OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.

MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...

Tony says nothing.

OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?

MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.

OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...

MANNY
No problem.

OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.

Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.

TONY
I'm scared.

MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.

TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.

MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?

TONY
So what does it matter?

MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?

Tony strips off his greasy apron.

TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!

COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.

TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.

Throws the Cook his apron.

What the fuck you gonna do!

TONY
Look after my investments.

31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.

The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.

32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.

MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!

At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.

CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.

MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....

Camera revealing the teenager.

Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?

ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.

MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?

ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.

As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.

MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,

CHI-CHI
Angel?

ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...

TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.

Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.

TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.

TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?

ANGEL
Sure thing.

As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:

TONY
Let's go....

CUT TO

33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.

34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.

TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....

Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.

TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.

The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?

Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.

TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

TOAD
I'm Hector...

Pause.

TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.

TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.

TONY
You know Omar.

TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.

TONY
Okay...

TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?

TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?

TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.

TONY
Yeah well I don't got it either, I
got it close by, too.

TOAD
Where, in the parking lot?

TONY
No. How far's your stuff?

Tony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel
out... The Lizard staring at him...

TOAD
Not far.

Pause. Everything seems okay.

TONY
So what do we do, walk in and start over?

TOAD
(changes subject)
Where you from?

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.

TONY
What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?

TOAD
I like to get to know who I do business with.

It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
move somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,
coiled and always watching.

TONY
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.

TOAD
Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...

TONY
Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?

36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
commotion.

ANGEL
Tony!

Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek, like a bird.

LIZARD
(slang Spanish)
Don't! Get up! Now shithead!

She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.

The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
Columbians, ""The Kids"".

They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.

As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

TONY
Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.

Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

TOAD
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?

TONY
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits

Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins
assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

CUT TO:

37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across
the street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.

38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.

39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny looks at his watch.

CUT TO

40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

Tony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
bathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
Angel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're
dead and they know it.

Toad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.

TOAD
(to Tony)
You watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.

Lizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who
nods and turns on the whirring machine.

The Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly
towards Angel.

The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his
brains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

Lizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.

The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.

TOAD
Now the leg, hunh?

A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

CUT TO

41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They
signal and separate.

CUT TO

42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.

TOAD
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.

He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
his blood, piss dead.

CUT TO

43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
notice.

At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...

CUT TO

44 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - 'DAY
The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
shower.

The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

TOAD
Last chance, carajo?

Tony, devastated, spits in his face.

TONY
Go fuck yourself.

Toad's eyes narrow meanly.

Kid one slaps the tape across Tony's mouth.

Kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to Tony's
wrist.

The Toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly there's a
gunshot from the hall.

45 INT./EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.

Manny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid
one, who is turning, in the neck.

Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.

The Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.

Manny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.

Manny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.

The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.

In sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.

In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

Chi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.

He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

Tony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.

TONY
I got him!

Manny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.

Chi-Chi sees Angel, gags.

CUT TO
46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46
The senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter
in astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

Their eyes follow.

As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts. He stands behind the Toad.

TONY
(Spanish)
Your turn, cabron!

The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.

Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.

The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then
an old lady faints.

The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.

CUT TO

47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.

TONY
Manny, you okay?

Manny nods.

TONY
Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!

CHI-CHI
Si!

48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM
Tony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
and busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.

Inside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.

He shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.

CUT TO
49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony
hurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)

Past the senior citizens who are retreating inside their
rooms.

The camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars
come screaming past them from the opposite direction.

CUT TO
50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
The booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.

TONY
Yeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.

OMAR'S VOICE
(shaken)
Look, let me check it out right away!

TONY
You do that, Omar, you do that.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the money?

TONY
Yeah -- and I got the yeyo.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the yeyo? Bring it here.

TONY
Fuck you. I'm taking it to the boss myself. Not you. Me.

OMAR'S VOICE
Okay, okay. All right. Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway. Look, meet me tonight at Hector's at eight.

TONY
Hey Omar...

OMAR'S VOICE
Yeah?

TONY
That was some pick up you sent us on.

Pause.

OMAR'S VOICE
What's that mean?

Tony hangs up, walks back to the sedan.

CUT TO

51 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - NIGHT
on Bricknell Avenue in a swank high-rise district adjacent
Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, the hub of South Miami...

The doorman shows Omar, Manny, his side bandaged, and Tony, carrying the suitcase, through giant glass portals, past seriously armed security cops in the lobby.

52 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52
A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?

TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.

LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.

TONY
Okay Frank.

Frank shakes hands with Manny.

LOPEZ
Howya doing?

MANNY
(awed)
...Fine yeah.

TONY
Manny Ray, he was with us on the job.

LOPEZ
(to Manny)
I hear you caught one?

Manny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.

MANNY
Just the flesh. Went right through.

LOPEZ
(heading for the bar)
Yeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.

TONY
(glances at Omar)
Yeah. Omar's terrific.

LOPEZ
Not to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.

TONY
You don't have to mention it. That was fun.

LOPEZ
(smiles, likes the kid's balls)
Scotch? Gin? Rum?

TONY
Gin's fine.

LOPEZ
(pouring)
Yeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.

TONY
Yeah... well.

Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.

TONY
...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.
(produces the money)
It's my gift to you -- from me.

Pause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.

LOPEZ
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....

He glances hard at Omar who squirms.

Without opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes
the suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.

LOPEZ
Don't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!

They drink the toast. With their eyes.

LOPEZ
Then you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.
(drinks)

TONY
Yeah, I hope I have that problem someday.

Lopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.

LOPEZ
Where the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?

The big bodyguard exits smoothly.

LOPEZ
(to the others)
The broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.

TONY
I guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
Yeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?
(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)

TONY
Yeah sure, I could eat a horse.

ERNIE
Here she comes, Mr. Lopez.

TONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.

LOPEZ
Oooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.

She doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.

**ALTERNATIVE**
LOPEZ
Where you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.

ELVIRA
You're always hungry, you should try starving.

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.

ELVIRA
Hello.

TONY
Uh... hi.

MANNY
(equally impressed)
Yeah, hi.

ELVIRA
I assume we're going to be a fivesome.
Where are we having dinner?

FRANK
Oh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.

ELVIRA
Again? If anyone wanted to assassinate
you, you wouldn't be too hard to find.

LOPEZ
(coming toward her, laughing)
Me? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.

ELVIRA
You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.

Neatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.

ELVIRA
Come on, Frank, let's go.

Tracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.

Lopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.

LOPEZ
Okay, let's go.

CUT TO
54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.

55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
The interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.

The crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
young, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, ""Celebrating"" or ""Partying Down Tonight"".

The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
and high heels.

Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
tough-looking tank tops with ""Motherfuckah"" and ""Fuck Me""
written on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.

MANNY
So whaddaya say, hunh?

He flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.

CHICK
You got a buck?

MANNY
Sure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?

CHICK
(indicates the machine)
Put it in, let's play.

MANNY
I had other things in mind.

CHICK
You check out on this and we'll talk about other things.

MANNY
(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)
Fuck, how do you play this thing?

CUT TO
56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56
Frank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug
of champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Over there that's Ronnie Echeverria.
Him and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....

Their point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.

LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.

Their point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.

LOPEZ
...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....

Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.

LOPEZ
. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?

TONY
'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?

LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.

ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.

The girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.

LOPEZ
That's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.
(eyeing Elvira)

HEAD WAITER
There you go, Mr. Lopez.

He's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.

LOPEZ
Give it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?

Head Waiter nods.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Five hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
In France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.

Tony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.

57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
A Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.

LOPEZ
Hey, George -- buddy.

MAN
Hey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?

The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.

LOPEZ
Oy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.

SHEFFIELD
Jack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.

LOPEZ
Yeah, almost everything.

SHEFFIELD
(to Elvira)
Elvira, you look terrific...
(to all)
Enjoy yourselves.

He ambles off.

LOPEZ
. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.

Tony looking off at him, remembering it.

LOPEZ
(raising his champagne glass)
So... here's to old friends...and new friends.

They toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.

LOPEZ
Well, Tony?

TONY
Hey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.

Lopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.

LOPEZ
(checking Tony's threads)
Yeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.

Omar doesn't like it but glances away.

TONY
Hey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.

The music shifts to slow dancing.

ELVIRA
(waving away cigar smoke)
So, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?

LOPEZ
Dance? I'd rather have a heart attack.

ELVIRA
(rising)
Don't foam into the Dom Perignon.

Glancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
How about you?

Tony nods sure, looks at his boss.

LOPEZ
(waves)
Go on!

They go.

58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.

LOPEZ
(to Omar)
What do you think?

OMAR
I think he's a fucking peasant.

LOPEZ
Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.

CUT TO
59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59
Tony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel
dance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in
the legs and shoulders.

TONY
...so what's your name, Elvira what?

ELVIRA
St. James.

TONY
Elvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?

He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.

ELVIRA
Baltimore...

TONY
Baltimore? Where's that?

ELVIRA
Look, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.

TONY
Just trying to be friendly.

ELVIRA
I've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.

He makes a point of looking at her.

TONY
Hey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.

ELVIRA
Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?

Tony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.
The man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony
doesn't see.

TONY
Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?

ELVIRA
(interrupting)
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.

TONY
Why you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?

Elvira laughs at him, furious.

ELVIRA
You know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.

TONY
(interrupting)
Now you're talking to me, baby!

ELVIRA
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.

TONY
Hey, thataway.

She whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.

CUT TO

63 CAR - DAWN
Tony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.

They've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.

TONY
That chick he's with... she loves me.

MANNY
(driving)
Oh yeah, how you know that?

TONY
The eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.

MANNY
You're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.

TONY
What are you kidding -- he's soft.
I seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.

Pause.

63-A OMITTED

64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the
American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American
leaving Miami please bring the flag?""

Tony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.

TONY
I shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...

MANNY
I want a line of bluejeans with my name on the
chicks' asses.

TONY
Yeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,
We never gonna score the big money working for Frank.

MANNY
Frank's okay.

TONY
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit? You thinkin' like
a chickenhead again

MANNY
Frank's got an organization.

TOW
Organization? I got more brains than Omar and he's bigger than me, That's not an organization. That`s a disorganization. What do you do for a brain man? Piss in it?

MANNY
Fuck you, somebody oughta shoot you, put you outta your misery
(seeing something)
Hey catch this tomato

Catching the eye of one of two young Girls passing, Manny
primps for them.

MANNY
Ooooh baby doll

TONY
Yeah, what do you girls say? you manna have some
ice cream with us somewhere?

They glance at Tony and Manny and hurry on.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin',

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you did know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
provoking Manny's laughter. Manny double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sengre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it...

TONY
Oooh ...cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.

Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.

TONY
Come on!

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.

Tony walks up to him, mocking.

TONY
I'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.
This country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls. Por Los cojonesl

MANNY
Hey Tony, last time this year you was in a fuckin' cage in Cuba. Why don't you take it easy Chico, slow down, one step at a time, be happy what you got you know? You get on your death bed you look around you think to yourself, when was I ever happy?

Camera moving with Tony as he glances in an elegant window displaying jewelry.

TONY
You be happy. I want what's comin' to me when I'm alive not when I'm dead.

MANNY (shakes his head)
Yeah, what's comin' to you Tony?

TONY
The world man, and everything in it.

As he goes into the store, the camera panning to the diamonds in the window.

CUT TO

65 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY
The house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.

66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY
From his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced
up and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of
gifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.

TONY
Be back in an hour okay.

MANNY
Okay... be cool.

Tony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.

67 EXT./INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
Tony's Mother opens the door.
A stout aging woman with a powerful face, she's shook to her roots.

TONY
(gently, in Spanish)
Mami... long time....

MAMS
No postcards from jail, hunh?

He doesn't offer to kiss her nor she him.

Pause.

Someone else is in the house. Mother looks behind her.
She opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.
He steps in. He looks.

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.

TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina...

GINA
Tony?

She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)

TONY
(covering his unwanted emotion)
Yeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....

He holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.

TONY
I got this for you, no big deal but....

GINA
Oh Tony!

Gina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his
arms, grasping him fiercely.

GINA
...it's you!

Tony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.

GINA
I never thought I'd see you again -- never!

Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.

TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?

Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.

TONY
...Yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
""To Gina From Tony. Always.""

GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....

The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.

TONY
...for you too Mama, look....

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.

GINA
It's beautiful... Mama,
(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')

Mama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.

TONY
(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)
Well anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!

Tossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a
bottle of champagne.

TONY
Oye ! To America!
(singing)
'America. America....'

CUT TO
69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,
as Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.

GINA
. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?

Tony nods.

GINA
It's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...

TONY
Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
with starting today. I didn't bring
up my kid sister to work in no hair
shop....

Mama looks over at him on the words ""bring up"" and he
catches her look.

TONY
...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.

He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
starts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,
looks.

TONY
(to Mama as he counts)
Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise
you. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.

Pushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.

TONY
That's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.

She approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the
bills, then looks back at her son.

MAMA
Who'd you kill for this Tony?

GINA
(aghast)
Mama!

TONY
I didn't kill nobody Mama,
(lying)

MAMA
No? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?

TONY
C'mon Mama. Things are different.
I'm working with this anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....

MAMA
Sure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....

GINA
(springing to her feet)
What are you saying Mama! He's your son!

MAMA
Son? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a
bum now!
(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)
Who do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....

TONY
Hey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....

MAMA
(continuing)
No, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --
(emphasizing it)
I raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy
money with you, it stinks!

She casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him
like dead lettuce.

A silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.

GINA
Oh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.
(to Tony)
I'm sorry Tony, I....

Tony nods his head at his mother.

TONY
(gently)
Okay, Mama, okay....
CUT TO

70 EXT. TONY'S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 70

Tony walks out icily.

MANNY
(waiting in the car, seeing his expression)
Relatives, hunh? A pain in the ass,
they ---

TONY
Shaddup!

He's climbing into the car when Gina hurries out the house.

GINA
Tony!

MANNY
Hey who's that?
Checks himself in the rearview mirror, slicks his hair.

Tony and Gina talk next to the car.

GINA
Tony-.-Mama -- since Papa took off....

TONY
Hey forget Papa, we never had one, okay? He was a bum!

GINA
(continuing)
. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?

TONY
(making light of it now)
Hey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.

GINA
Tony, I know you did some bad things
back then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.

TONY
Communists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.

GINA
Mama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.

Pause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.

TONY
Hey I know... I know.

She gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.

TONY
Say, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?

She hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.

TONY
Go on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?

He gets in the car. She peers in.

GINA
You can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?

Her eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.
He smiles back with charm.

Gina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw. The sedan drives off.

71 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 71

MANNY
(driving)
cone, you -never told me you had
Hey,
such a good-looking doll for a sister!

Tony looks at him icily.
TONY
Stay away Manny, don't ever let me catch you fuckin' around with her, don't ever fuck around with her....

MANNY
(feeling heat)
Sure...sure.

A beat.

72 MONTAGE - PASSING TIME 72
Music accompanying the flipping of calendar leaves.

73 U.S. CUSTOMS - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 73
Tony, spruce in his new three-piece suit with the diamond on
the finger and the expensive watch, looks like the young
ethnic American businessman in import-export as he steps in
front of a chunky, young Customs Officer, who looks at him coldly.

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Mind opening that, sir?

Tony, calm, unzips the chic leather single suitcase, his
eyes drifting around....
A woman, with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage, is cursorily checked through an adjacent line.
A nun is waived through the third line.
A stockbroker waiting in a fourth line, glances nervously in Tony's direction.
Tony looks away, back at the Officer who is thoroughly
ransacking the suitcase looking for a false bottom. He waits, confident.
An old man is waived through a fifth line,

75 EXT. DOLLY STASH'S HOUSE - MIAMI - DAY 75
The mother-type unscrews the handles of the baby carriage,
pulling out the wrapped cocaine, while Chi-Chi extricates
another load from the kid's panda bear which is now in
shreds.


76 THE OLD MAN 76
helped by Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom
from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.

77 MANNY AND GASPAR 77
break open wooden clothes hangers concealing cocaine as the stockbroker changes clothes.

78 THE MOTHER 78
picks up the baby and removes cocaine from its diaper.
While:

79 THE FORMER NUN 79
in partial habit, steps out of the toilet, adjusting her underpants; she places a package of cocaine on a table, on which we now see approximately five kilos stacked.

80 TONY 80
counting out the cash for his mules, Omar there, overlooking the operation.

81 MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 81
Again. But this time going out.

The nun, now a housewife, going through an exit gate carrying hand luggage.

82 TONY 82
watching, glances up at the electronic information board and the boarding gate--
Houston clocks out the time.-- we move to Los Angeles -- ""on time"" ---

Tony's eyes moving to the mother, now without the child,
buying her ticket at the counters.
Manny joins him, nodding okay.
Tony, with a glance at his watch, starts out the terminal.
The roar of the aircraft blending with city sounds as we continue the rapid pace of the montage with music.

86 EXT. GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86
Frank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.

87 INT. LAUNDRY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 87
The plush millionaire's restaurant is to be seen again.
Frank has his arm around Tony, introducing him to a business-type. Elvira looks on.

88 INT. HIGH-FASHION STORE - DAY 88
In a high-fashion store, Tony buys a beautiful dress for Gina who is delighted when she sees herself in the mirror, hugs Tony. Manny watches, unable to take his eyes off her.

SALESLADY
(admiringly to Tony)
Your wife looks terrific in that.

TONY
My wife? You gotta be kidding.

89 INT. LOBBY - LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 89
Elvira steps out in a Pucci summer dress, looks around. Tony is waiting for her. She's surprised.

TONY
He got held up at the golf club. He told me to pick you up. He`ll meet us at the race track.

Elvira contemplating him with distaste.

TONY
He said if he was late to get Ice Cream first.

She sighs, walks across the lobby. He follows.

90 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 90

Elvira steps out of the lobby into the driveway.  He points.

TONY
Over there....

She looks. The car is a yellow Cadillac convertible with 2
big fins and Snoopy the dwarf dashboard statue with stickers
all over the fenders. Adding to the impression are Manny
and Chi-Chi waiting in the backseat.

ELVIRA
(registers it with distaste)
That thing? You must be kidding.

TONY
(hurt)
Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.

ELVIRA
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.

TONY
It's got a few years on it but it's 'a creampuff.'

ELVIRA
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

91 INT. LUXURY MOTOR SALES - CORAL GABLES - DAY 91
Camera moves around a slick, red Jaguar -- XG 6 -- with Tony, accompanied by Manny, Chi-Chi, the Salesman. Elvira waits aloofly off to the side.

TONY
(to Elvira)
So you like this better?

ELVIRA
(shrugs)
It's got style.

TONY
Yeah it looks like one of the tigers from India.

MANNY
(to Elvira)
Tony been dragging me around to the zoos, looking at tigers. He wants to buy one of them too.
(amused)
He do that he gonna have no friends left. Not that he got any now.

TONY
You'll like the tiger Manny, you'll see.

ELVIRA
You going to drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat Tony?

TONY
Yeah... maybe some lady tiger.
(to Salesman)
How much?

SALESMAN
Twenty-eight thousand dollars. Fully equipped.

TONY
(genuinely)
That all?

SALESMAN
Machine gun turrets are extra.

TONY
(circling the car)
Funny guy hunh... Manny, c'mere.

Manny comes over and Tony walks him along the car, in
quieter tones.

TONY
Get these sections bullet-proofed... here... here... these windows...

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
...and a phone with a scrambler.

MANNY
Okay...

TONY
...And one of those radio scanners, y'know, pick out flying saucers and stuff.

MANNY
Yeah, a good one.

ELVIRA
(joining them)
Don't forget the fog lights.

TONY
Yeah, in case I go to the swamps, good idea.

ELVIRA
(impatiently)
I thought you were taking me to Frank?

TONY
(glances at his watch)
We still got an hour. You hungry?

ELVIRA
No, but I'm bored.

TONY
Figgers. Check it out, will you Manny and pay the guy and grab a
taxi out to the track....

Thanks, yeah....

TONY
(before leaving)
Oh yeah.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private joke. He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, ""Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag.""

Elvira wonders about it as he joins her.

TONY
Somebody gotta keep the animals out.

92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92
Tony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.

TONY
I'm glad you came. I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.

ELVIRA
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?

TONY
Yeah -- you know who.
They get in the car.

ELVIRA
And what would Frank say?

She has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then
other, then takes a last hit through the mouth.

TONY
I like Frank.. -but I like you better.

He reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,
staring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He
kisses her. She goes with it.

Pause. She pulls back.

ELVIRA
(same tone of voice as before)
Don't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.

As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.

CUT TO
INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.

Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.

SOSA
So this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...

Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose.
Pause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.

SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.

OMAR
That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.

SOSA
Yes, it would've been nice if he could have come.

TONY
(cutting in)
and he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?

SOSA
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)
So he sent you?

TONY
Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.

Looking over the laboratory like it was his.
Omar glances at him, annoyed.

SOSA
We'll talk at my house. Shall we go...

CUT TO
94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94
The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

SOSA
(to Omar)
...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.

OMAR
Well, we do that, we gotta take the
risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You
know what that means?

TONY
That means we gotta go to war with
`em.
looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make
Sosa
of this guy.
SOSA
When we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.

TONY
Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.

SOSA
Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.

TONY
13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You
know what that's like these days?
They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.

Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

SOSA
What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.

Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.

The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
A beat.
He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

OMAR
(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)
Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!

Tony shrugs.

SOSA
Where were we?

TONY
Panama. You're looking for a partner, right?

Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.

SOSA
...something like that.
(chuckles)

OMAR
Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...

TONY
Hey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.

OMAR
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!

TONY
(shrugs)
Frank'll love it. Don't worry about it.

OMAR
That's up to Frank -- not you.

He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing
-- also an advantage in the split.

OMAR
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...

SOSA
It's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to
Frank.

OMAR
(a beat)
Okay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.

SOSA
(without hesitation)
Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.
You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.

Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.

OMAR
Yeah. I guess so....

TONY
Great.

SOSA
(glancing at Tony, to Omar)
...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.

OMAR
(doesn't get it)
I don't think that...

TONY
(lighting a cigar)
Hey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...

Sosa laughs. Omar scowls.

CUT TO

95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95

The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:
Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.

The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.

Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

TONY
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?

SOSA
Why?

TONY
Cause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.

Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

TONY
(overlapping the joke)
They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.

SOSA
Maybe he'll move to Miami too...
Gabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?

Sosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.

GABRIELLA
(distracted)
Lovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.

SOSA
I'll take care of it myself.

GABRIELLA
(turning to him)
...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.

SOSA
Of course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...
(to Tony)
My fiance, Gabriella Montini.

TONY
Hello....
She nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.

GABRIELLA
It's a pleasure.

She withdraws. Tony watches her go.

TONY
I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.

SOSA
(focusing the binoculars)
I like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel
the same way about the rest of your organization.

Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.

TONY
In-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?

SOSA
I mean Omar Suarez.

Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.

Sosa passes him the binoculars.

SOSA
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.
From several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....

Tony, astonished, looks up.

96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96
terrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.

SOSA
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.

Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
A silence.


97 TONY 97
shaken, lowers the binoculars.
Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.
Tony looks back at him, contemplative.
Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.

SOSA
So how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?

TONY
(awry, stalks up to him)
Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.
That piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..
For all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!

SOSA
(moves away)
I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this
Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.

TONY
Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.
(then)
You got my word on that.

Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,
makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony
following the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.

SOSA
You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.

Their eyes locked together.

AERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98
In all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach
and rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.
Music theme continuing over.

REVERSE WIPE TO

99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99
In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
outside his office.
He jerks his head. Inside. They go.

CUT TO
100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100
The office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,
Cuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on
JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares
incredulously at Tony.

LOPEZ
(livid)
You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars
without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy!

TONY
Hey take it easy Frank, cone.

LOPEZ
Con0 my ass!

TONY
At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank... we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank. Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.

LOPEZ
Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.

TONY
Frank... Frank...

LOPEZ
(ranting)
You know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?
...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.
Cause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?
(pause, eyeing Tony)
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?

TONY
You saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?

Lopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.

LOPEZ
(carefully)
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall
your deal with Sosa.

Long pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.

TONY
(finally)
...have it your way boss.

He turns to leave, nods to Manny.

LOPEZ
Montana... just remember I am the boss.

TONY
Sure you're the boss.

Gets to the door, Manny joining him.

LOPEZ
Y'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.

Tony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.

101 EXT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE 101
Just outside the door, Tony glances at Manny's question-mark
expression.

TONY

Fuck him!

101 - EXT. SHEFFIELD'S OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - 101



102 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 102
Tony, impeccable in Cardin whites, and Manny, also slicked
up, are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office.
Behind the desk sits the heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed lawyer,

George Sheffield smoking yet another cigarette, his voice a
hoarse gravelled croak, the eyes -- with their deadpan stare
-- always pausing before they speak. He doesn't get up from
his desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the
Mutiny Club.

SHEFFIELD
What can I do for you Montana?

TONY
(indicates Manny)
My partner. Manny Ray.

Manny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes
briefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.

TONY
So George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.

SHEFFIELD
Did they also tell you how expensive I am?

TONY
Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.

SHEFFIELD
I see you been reading your American history Montana, what've you done lately to earn a place in it?

TONY
(chuckles)
I'm trying to stay outta it, y'know
what I mean? I'm expanding my operation. So I want a class guy like you on the payroll -- advising me. Starting now.

SHEFFIELD
(a longer pause than usual)
Cash. On the table.
...Start with a $100,000.

TONY
(an equal pause)
Sure...

He sticks out his hand. Manny slaps an envelope in it. Tony
begins counting out the cash, right on the tabletop.

CUT TO

103 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - DAY 103
Tony waits in his red Jaguar in the driveway of the building.
Lopez and his bodyguard exit the building.
A limousine pulls up.
Tony watches.
The threesome get in the limo and drive away.
Tony gets out of the car, crosses to the entrance.

104 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 104
Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face. She`s
in jeans, barefoot and casual.

ELVIRA
Tony?

TONY
Hi there.

Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
explanation. There is none.

ELVIRA.
ml.. -you just missed Frank.

TONY
I didn't come here to see Frank.
She looks at him amazed. The balls on this guy!

ELVIRA
(cooling to him fast)
This is not the time or the place.
Next time make an appointment first.

She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
bulls in.

TONY
I got something important to tell ya.
Why don't you make some drinks and act normal.

ELVIRA
Sure. Why not? We're all normal here.

She heads for the pool, nonplussed. Tony closes the door, eases slowly across the room towards her, awkwardly trying to make conversation.

TONY
I heard you was in Europe travelling 'round all by yourself. Woman like you shouldn't have to travel alone...
(pause, no response)
I been travelling myself.

ELVIRA
Broadening your intellect. I heard.

TONY
What else d'you hear?

ELVIRA
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.

TONY
Yeah. It makes things easier this way, don't it?

She's puzzled. He drinks a toast.

TONY
Here's to the land of opportunity.

ELVIRA
For you maybe.

She drinks to it.

TONY
Hey, do you like kids?

ELVIRA
Kids? Sure, why not -- as long as there's a nurse.

TONY
Good. Cause I like kids too. I like boys and girls.

She's waiting. He paws the ground, awkward as a bull.

ELVIRA
That's broad of you, Tony. Travelling really helped. Look, Frank's going to be back any moment and when he walks through that....

TONY
Yeah. Yeah -- fuck Frank. Look, here's the story. I'm from the gutter but I climbed out of it. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here in Miami. I could  be like Frank but bigger -- The biggest!

Elvira's looking at him like he's on the moon.

TONY
Anyway what I came up here to tell you is that.. .uh I like you. I think you're terrific. I known this the first time I seen you. You belong to me. We're tigers. The two of us... I want you to marry me and be the mother of my children.

Silence.

ELVIRA
(stunned)
Me? Marry you?

She laughs, a short harsh laugh.

TONY
(sincere)
Yeah... -marry me.

ELVIRA
What about Frank? What are you going to do about Frank?

TONY
Frank's not gonna last...
(puts down the drink, puts his hand on hers)
I'm not looking for an answer right now Elvira, but I want you to think about it, okay? I want you to think hard... I'll see you the next time.

He goes. She stares at him, still dazed, yet deep down -- flattered.

CUT TO

105 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105

The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
refined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out
of his path, he angles through them.

OWNER
(indicating a table)
Over here.

Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.

TONY
What the fuck is she doing here, she's....
(heading towards her)

MANNY
(stops him)
Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake. What do you give her money for if you don't want her to go out, have some fun?

Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves back. Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.

TONY
Who's she with?

MANNY
Some kid, he works for Luco, he's harmless....

Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him. Caucasian,
about 250 pounds.

TONY
Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
don't dance too close.

MANNY
Sure Tony.
(drifting away)
I'll be at the table.

LARGE MAN
(intersecting)
Hello Tony, you remember me?


TONY
(to the Large Man)
Yeah, sure. You're...
(snaps fingers trying to remember)
...Bernstein, right. Mel Bernstein.
Narcotics, right?

BERNSTEIN
That's right, Tony.
I think we better talk.
(indicates a quieter area)

There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's cause just the eyes do the smiling.

TONY
Talk about what, what's there to talk about? I ain't killed anybody
lately.

BERNSTEIN
No not lately but we can go back to ancient history.
Like Emilio Rebenga, like a bunch of whacked Indians at
the Sun-Ray Motel in Miami Beach....

TONY
Oh yeah? ...you know Mel, whoever's giving you your information must be taking you guys for a long ride.

BERNSTEIN
Are we gonna talk or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls, Tony baby -- here and now?

Tony looks at him.

CUT TO
106 INT. BABYLON CLUB - CORNER TABLE - TONY AND MEL 106
in a corner of the Babylon -- talking.

BERNSTEIN
Yeah, so the news on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo
Tony... that you're no longer a small-time hood, you're public property now, and the Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded....

TONY
No shit -- how much?

BERNSTEIN
(doodling on a piece of paper)
There's an answer to that too....

He holds the paper up briefly in front of Tony. It says ""25,000""

TONY
(reacts)
That's a big number.

BERNSTEIN
That's on a monthly basis. Every month the same thing. You know how this works, don't you? We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me. When we hit, it hurts -- Same thing works the other way. You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.

TONY
S'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?

BERNSTEIN
That's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.
(getting up)
I don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?
...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to
London, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.

Tony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.

BERNSTEIN
I like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.
But you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.
Everyday aboveground's a good day.

He winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.

Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.
Tony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....

107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107
Elvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,
the bodyguard. Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy,
the Owner, and Elvira drifts in.
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her.
She sees him coming, glances in Frank's direction.
Tony comes right up to her.

TONY
Hi...

ELVIRA
Hello, Tony.

Lopez, in conversation with the Owner, glances over, sees
Tony with Elvira, his expression narrows.

TONY
so.. .Did you think about.what I said? About the kids?

ELVIRA
Tony, you're really nuts you know, -- you really are.

Lopez comes over, takes Elvira's arm, and smiles at Tony.

LOPEZ
Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl?

TONY
That's what I'm doing, Frank.

Tense look on Frank's face. The bodyguard circles.

LOPEZ
(without a smile)
Then go do it somewhere else. Get
lost.

ELVIRA
Frank, he was only...

TONY
(ignoring her)
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes,
man.

LOPEZ
You won't be hearing anything, you
go on like this.

TONY
You gonna stop me?

Frank is livid.

LOPEZ
You're fucking right I am. I'm giving you orders.
Blow. (Esfumate)

The bodyguard moves closer to Tony who doesn't move.

Manny suddenly slides into frame, backing Tony.

TONY
(icy)
Orders? There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.

Pause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the
crest. Lopez abruptly turns away.

LOPEZ
(to Elvira)
Let's go!

ELVIRA
Frank, this is ridiculous....

LOPEZ
C'mon!

He crowds her. she goes. Angry, Tony watches as they exit the club.

MANNY
What happened?

TONY
That cocksucker! -- He put that homicide prick Bernstein on me.

They stroll back to the table.

MANNY
What for?

TONY
The Emilio Rebenga hit. Remember that.

MANNY
You're kidding!

TONY
Who else knew about it? Omar's fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me.

MANNY
I don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony. Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York?

TONY
You go. I like the weather here just fine.

He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
stairs to the toilets.
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
after her.

MANNY
Hey, where you going?

He doesn't answer.

CUT TO
108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E
Tony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself
into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
him. No Gina.

109 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109
He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
the door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
burgundy suit running his hand along her ass.

GINA
(shocked)
Tony!

TONY
What are you doing! What are you doing!

He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
times into the wall.

GINA
(trying to restrain him)
Tony! What're you doing! You're crazy!

He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.

TONY
(to Gina)
What are you doing with this shit, hunh?
(back to burgundy suit)
Get the fuck out of here, maricon, y'hear, I'll kill you next time.

GINA
Fernando!

TONY
(to Gina)
Shaddup!

Manny runs in, several others now looking in from the hall.

MANNY
Tony!

Tony shoves burgundy suit out of the stall, past Manny.

TONY
Go on!

GINA
What the hell is....

TONY
You think it's cute somebody puttin' their hands all over your ass, my kid sister, hunh? In a toilet!

GINA
It's none of your business!

TONY
The fuck it isn't! Three dollar hooker, that's what you are.
Snorting shit like that at your age, you oughta ---

GINA
What are you -- a priest? A cop! Look at your life. You can't tell
me what to do!

TONY
I'm telling ya! I don't wanna see you in here again. I catch you in here I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.

GINA
Oh yeah! Go ahead!

TONY
You're getting outta here right now!
Don't push me baby, don't push me!

GINA
Don't fucking push me!

MANNY
Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air...

The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
the hallway. Several more people are watching.

GINA
You got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!

Tony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.
Tony stands there, abated.

The crowd is silent.

Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.

MANNY
(tender)
Come on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.
(strokes her face)

TONY
(disturbed, to Manny)
Get her home, get her outta here!

He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
no regrets, but disturbed.

Manny helps Gina to her feet.

MANNY
Come on, pussycat, I'll buy you a
cup of coffee.

CUT TO
110 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 110
Tony, isolated and edgy, reenters the main room, circling
the edges of the crowd, up to the bar.

TONY

Gimme a double of that!

He turns, catches a last glimpse of Gina leaving with Manny.

CUT TO
111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111
Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
coupe. She's still angry.

GINA
...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
Mama's right. She says he hurts everything he touches.
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
again. Never!

MANNY
He loves you, what do you want. He
feels he raised you.

GINA
He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!

MANNY
Hey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...

GINA
Against what?

MANNY
'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.

He says it like it's personal.

GINA
(picks up on it)
I like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.

MANNY
(a face)
What future's he got? On a bandstand somewhere? He's a bum, Why don't you go out with somebody who's
going somewhere?

She gives him a look.

GINA
Like who?

MANNY
Like a doctor or a dentist or something.

GINA
What about you? Why don't you take me out?

She's looking straight at him now, challenging.

MANNY
What? Me?

GINA
Yeah, you. I see the way you look at me -- Manolo Ribera.

MANNY
(nervous)
Hey, Tony's like my brother.. You're his kid sister, okay?

GINA
So what?

MANNY
So....

GINA
(taunting)
You afraid of Tony? You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

MANNY
Fuck no....

112 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112
Pulls the car over to the curb.

MANNY
I guess we're here.

Pause.

GINA
You think about it, okay, you think about it real hard, Manny. Cause you don't know what you're missing....

She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.

She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.

CUT BACK TO
113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113
The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night'.

OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?
Now I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.

He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.

Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.

Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...

...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....

Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....

The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors...
Screams, crowd diving for cover...

Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of
his ankle, firing...
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...

Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.

Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.

The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.

CUT TO
114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114
Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.

Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.

The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.

Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.

Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.

Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.

Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

CUT TO

115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115
Tony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
it, doesn't express a reaction.

DOCTOR
It's going to be sore for a few months.

TONY
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer...
(to Chi-Chi)
Find out where Lopez is....

CUT TO
116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116
Miriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with ""Cocaine"" written on it.

TONY'S VOICE
Miriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?

MIRIAM
Yeah... It's Tony.

Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror, takes the phone, in good spirits.

MANNY
Tony cabrone, whatcha doing -- checking up on me, too?

117 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT INT. 117

TONY
Look, get your fuckin' clothes on and meet me outside Lopez's office in forty-five minutes. That phonebooth on 9th. Yeah.
Move your ass!

118 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 118

MANNY
What happened!

119 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
TONY (v.o.)
Nothing we can't fix.

Tony hangs up.

120 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 120

MANNY
(grabs his pants)
I gotta go.

MIRIAM
This is worse than fucking a grasshopper, man.

MANNY
Hey, I'm better looking.
(hits the coke again)
Don't do it all, I'll be back later.

CUT TO
121 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:
Tony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.

TONY
(to Nick)
Nick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?

NICK
Yeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.

TONY
All you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'

NICK
Yeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...

CUT TO
122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122
Waldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny
and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.

LOPEZ'S VOICE
...you're kidding! Three to two?
Son of a bitch!...
(cradling the phone)
Guess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!

MUFFLED VOICE
Congratulations. That's great Frank.

Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
with guns casually drawn.

123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123

TONY
Yeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?

Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
there and then, but manages to recover.

LOPEZ
Tony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.

Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
other side of the room.

LOPEZ
Tony... what happened to you, hunh?

TONY
Yeah, lookit. They spoiled one of
my $800 suits.

LOPEZ
Jesus! Who?

in his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

TONY
Hitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.
Never seen 'em before...Hiya
ii:;. Is there an answer to this too?

BERNSTEIN
(uneasy)
Always is Montana, always is...

LOPEZ
Jesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.

TONY
Hey, you might be right.

LOPEZ
Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.

TONY
(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)
Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.

Pause.

LOPEZ
(awkward)
Well... What are the guns for Tony?

TONY
(shrugs)
What for? I'm paranoid I guess.

The phone rings.
Lopez lets the phone ring.

TONY
Why don't you answer it Frank?

LOPEZ
Must be Elvira. You know women.
After we left that joint she....

The phone rings again.

TONY
(reaches for it)
I'll tell her you're not here.

LOPEZ
(grabs the phone first)
Wait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...
(anxious)
Yeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.

He hangs up. Pause.

TONY
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

LOPEZ
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony?

Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

TONY
You know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!

LOPEZ
Tony, no! Lissen!

TONY
You remember what a 'haza' is Frank?
It's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.

LOPEZ
(nervous)
Why would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !

TONY
Yeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the
side but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!

He squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.

LOPEZ
Mel! Mel! Do something, please!

Mel sits there impassively.

MEL
It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.

LOPEZ
Please Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll
give you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay! I'll go away Tony, I disappear, you'll never
see me again. Just gimme a chance, gimme a second chance Tony, please... please!

He sobs pathetically.

LOPEZ
I don't wanna die Tony, I never did nothing to nobody Tony! I never hurt nobody!

TONY
Yeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.

He turns to Manny.

TONY
Manny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?

Tony steps aside.

LOPEZ
No! No! Tony!

Manny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.
Lopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in
his bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.

TONY
...Every dog has his day.

He fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN
(remaining calmly in his chair)
I told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.

TONY
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.

His eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.

BERNSTEIN
Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.

TONY
I'm not Mel. You are.

He produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his
left hand pointed at the big man.

BERNSTEIN
(rising from his chair)
Hey, c'mon, what is this?
You can't shoot a cop, Tony.

TONY
Whoever said you were one?

He fires.

Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.

BERNSTEIN
I... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...

TONY
Sure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.

He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is
no longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.

MANNY
(indicates bodyguard)
What about him?

Tony notices.
The bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.

TONY
You want a job Ernie?

ERNIE
Sure, Tony.

TONY
Come see me tomorrow.

ERNIE
Thanks, Tony.

Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.

MANNY
(Offscreen)
Okay, torch it!

CUT TO
124 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - THAT NIGHT 124

Elvira lies in her silk sheets. The doorbell rings. She
gets up.

In a nightgown, she opens the front door.

ELVIRA
Tony?

Tony, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling, moves past her into the apartment.

ELVIRA
What's happened?

Tony just stands there.

ELVIRA
Where's Frank?

TONY
Where do you think? ...Why don't you go pack your stuff. We're going home.

Pause. She understands, moves quietly past him towards the
bedroom.

Tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace,
breathing in the air. The lights of Miami wink at his feet...

. . . the camera moving to one sign down there that says it
all, flashing its big neon bracelet ---

In an exclusive area of Coral Gables, surrounded by walls,
security gates, acres of lawns and a guarded boat dock on a
canal. Tony has erected his fortress-like Shangri-La, to
which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
sign on the front lawn that says:
THE WORLD IS YOURS

MONTANA TRAVEL CO.

Just like it should be.

. . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely short dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina, her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her, evenly and openly as....
Tony and Elvira kiss.

151 EXT. TONY'S GROUNDS - SAME DAY 15

Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira, nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.

Across a moat of water, a striped nine-foot Bengal tiger stretches majestically under a solitary banyan tree, extending a giant claw and licking himself.

Tony and Chi-Chi kidding around with the tiger.

From their point of view, we see Tony leading the entourage
back to the mansion as Chi-Chi throws the Bengal his wedding
cake.

CUT TO
151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B

Tony, accompanied by Manny, walks a young, thirtyish bank
president into his office, which is rigged with video monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.

There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs -- but not one sign of a book on the walls.

Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who never stops thinking money.

TONY
...yeah, well, I can't pay that no more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money. So I think it's time you bank boys come down a bit, y'know, like....

BANKER
Hey, Tony, c'mon, that's crazy, I can't do...

TONY
That's too bad, cause....

BANKER
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation here, we're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give us the harder it is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.

TONY
You gonna what, Jerry?

BANKER
Tony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.

TONY
Ten points!

we go someplace else.
Hey, Tony,

BANKER
Tony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it. You're not gonna find a better deal.

TONY
Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the Bahamas myself.

BANKER
You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a regular basis? Once maybe. And then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with twenty million of your hard-earned dollars? C'mon Tony, don't be a schmuck -- who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.

Tony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting
he has another engagement,

BANKER
Stay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.
See you. Take care.

Going.

Tony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:

TONY
That prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's
come over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....

So why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.

TONY
I don't know. Mob guys -- guineas -- I don't trust 'em.

On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker, leaving. Now beginning to see things through the glass darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually -- passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.

TONY
(eyes wandering across to another video monitor)
You get the house sweeped this month? The cars?

MANNY
Yeah, sure, I told you that. Five thousand it set us back.

TONY
See that cable truck there?

152 INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - VIDEO MONITORS 152
Tony's eyes fixing on the cable TV truck parked across the
street.
A man is hauling cable.
There are other private gates visible. The area is lush with gardens, Spanish moss, cypresses and quietly respectable million dollar houses with their Spanish tile roofs and balconies.

MANNY
Yeah?

TONY
Hey Manny when does it take three
days to rig a cable, hunh?

MANNY
Cops.

TONY
What if it's the Diaz brothers? What if they're gonna come and get me?

MANNY
I'll check it out.

TONY
You check it out, then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Bogota.

MANNY
The truck could be anything. We're not the only dopers living on the block y'know.

TONY
Hey you got some attitude y'know Manny -- for a guy in charge of my security.

Hey I'll check it out. I'm just telling you we're spending too much
on this counter-surveillance shit. Twelve percent y'know, of our adjusted gross -- that's not pocket money.

TONY
You worry about it, it lets me sleep
good at night. There's that fat guy
again.

Manny looks over at a jogger running by the gate -- of the
porcine quality, civilian-looking, fifties.

TONY
I seen him every day. 'Bout a week now.

MANNY
So the guy jogs around the neighborhood. He's some fat accountant.

TONY
How the fuck do you know what he is?

MANNY
Hey if he's a cop, don't you think running in circles around a house is a pretty dumb way to watch it?

TONY
Maybe not...
(walks away, stops, looks back)
I'm telling you we're getting sloppy -- our thinking -- our attitude.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!

TELEVISION COMMERCIAL
A television spot for Florida Security Trust (or Miami Security Trust or Dade Security Trust depending on legal options). A respectable business-type walks along the sidewalk with a renascent downtown Miami as a backdrop. Skyscrapers, glinting glass, cranes....

BANK SPOKESMAN
Here at Florida Security Trust we've
been putting your money to work for a
better America. We've been around for seventy-five years. We'll be here tomorrow.

A logo for the firm over with the reminder ""Since 1907.""

Camera pulling back to reveal Tony watching in his huge gold-
leaf bathtub, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looks
like a character in a Futzie Nutzie loafing cartoon, with his
TV hooked to one side of the tub, a long phone line to the
other, and a radio and portable bar all within reach.

TONY
(to the TV)
Yeah that's cause for seventy-five years you been fucking all of us over, that's why.
(to Manny)
Somebody oughta do something about these whores. Charging me ten points on my money and they're getting away with it! There's no laws anymore,anything goes.
Listen, these guys been here for a thousand years. They got all the angles figured.

Manny straddles a chair next to the tub watching the m
news that was interrupted by the Florida Security Trust
commerical. Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself
up in front of a giant mirror. It's some bathroom --
gigantic with a chandelier hanging in the middle of it,
Italian marble, plants, skylights, rugs, etc....

TONY
You know what capitalism is --
Getting fucked.

ELVIRA
A true capitalist if ever I met one.

She's doing a toot of coke off a flat mirror.

TONY
How would you know, bubblehead? You ever do nothing 'sides get your hair fixed and powder your nose? You do too much of that shit anyway.

ELVIRA
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that Tony.

TONY
Know what? Why do you always got to talk like that?

MANNY
(changing the subject)
So I had a pow-wow with this guy
Seidelbaum today. He checks out.
I  got another meet set up.

TONY
When?

MANNY
Thursday ten o'clock. I thought I'd take Chi-Chi with me. Do a million and some change. Get my- feet wet with this guy.

TONY
That's a lot of wet. I'm not Rockefeller. Not yet.

Tony points to a figure on the TV.

TONY
Hey, listen to this, guy's always good for a laugh.

Visual of silver-haired television Anchorman -- Vic Phillips -- with a bit of show business image in him -- to be seen again. Underneath his face, it says ""Editorial.""

NEWS ANCHORMAN
...the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated $100 billion a year business? It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them. These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element...
(pause for effect)
I am not one of those voices.

TONY
(responding)
What do you know -- you never been right in your life, Vic baby...
(to Manny)
Guy never fuckin' tells the truth.
It's the guys like him, the bankers and the politicians who want to keep the coke illegal so's they can make more money and get the votes to fight the bad guys. They're the bad guys.
They'll fuck anything for a buck....

ELVIRA
And what about you Tony? Can't you stop talking about it all the time, can't you stop saying fuck? -- it's boring, it's boring!

TONY
What's boring?

ELVIRA
You're boring. Money, money, money!
That's all I hear in this house. Frank never talked about money.

TONY
Cause Frank was dumb.

ELVIRA
You know what you've become Tony -- an arriviste, an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking about how much money he's got or how he's getting fucked. Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.

TONY
What're you talking about, I worked my ass off for all this.

ELVIRA
(starts out)
It's too bad. Somebody should've given it to you. You would've been a nicer person.

TONY
Hey you know what your problem is pussycat....

ELVIRA
(at the lip of the bathroom)
What is my problem, Tony?

TONY '.
...you got nothing to do with your life that's what.

MANNY
Tony, c'mon....

TONY
Why don't you get a job y'know? Be a nurse, work with blind kids, lepers, open a stationary store, I don't give a shit. Anything beats lying around waiting for me to fuck you all the time.

ELVIRA

Don't toot your horn honey, you're not that good.

TONY
Me and Nick'11 take care of it. You

Why! It's my deal.

TONY
You stink as a negotiator, that's why. You like the ladies more'n you do the money -- that's your problem Manny.

Hey wait a second, I'm your partner

Who do I trust -- me, that's who....

DISSOLVE TO

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
""CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160
The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
moving, talking.
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.

The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
look the part.

It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.
At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.

LUIS
. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
I was in that picture down in Columbia.
Burn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.
We're good friends. I was his driver...

NICK
(stacking)
Oh yeah?

LUIS
Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.
(pause)
Yeah, I also know Paul Newman. I worked with him in Tucson.

NICK THE PIG
That so? Say, you know Benny
Alvarez there?

LUIS
Uh...

SEIDELBAUM
(interrupting to Tony)
Now you want a company check here for $283,107.65?

TONY
(pause, checking his fingers)
Uh... I come up with 284.6

SEIDELBAUM
(pauses, looks again at his figures)
No, that's just not possible. The
machine don't make mistakes.

TONY
Well, we'll count it again.

SIEDELBAUM
Oh Jesus!

TONY
Hey business is business. We're talking $1500.

SEIDELBAUM
(exasperated)
Okay, you keep the change okay, I don't give a shit.

TONY
Okay but I'll go through it again with you.

Seidelbaum ignores it, counting up another stack.

SEIDELBAUM
Okay... This check now, this one goes to the...

TONY
Montana Realty Company.

NICK
(to Luis)
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?

DISSOLVE TO

161 INT. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY
They're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke
filling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest
of green and they're still counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their eyes.

SEIDELBAUM
We're up to what?

LUIS
(consulting his notes)
Seven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.

TONY
(grins)
Hey we're almost finished. Another 200 thousand and we can take a leak.

SIEDELBAUM
Yeah, but this'll do fine.

Pulls a pistol from his ankle and rises.

SEIDELBAUM
You're under federal arrest, Montana,
for a continuing criminal conspiracy.
The RICO Statute. Get 'em up.

Tony astonished.

TONY
Oh shit... You're not kidding hunh?

Eyes darting. Considering the options. The little fat man's eyes are suddenly agile and mean-.-Tony reads them, lifts his arms.

SEIDELBAUM
(to Luis)
Get it.

Luis moves around Tony to disarm him.

TONY
So how do I know you guys are cops?

Luis, produces a wallet with identification, shoves it under Tony's nose.

LUIS
What's that say, asshole?
Insert: Photograph and Drug Enforcement Agency ID.

TONY
(impressed)
Hey that's good work, where can I get one of those?

LUIS
Cabron! You call yourself Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up.

SEIDELBAUM
Looie! Cool it.

TONY
(unfazed; wiping the sweat off)
Call your dog off, Seidelbaum. I wanna call my lawyer.

SEIDELBAUM
Lotta good he's gonna do you Montana. There's an eye there in the wall.
(points)
Say hi, honey....

162 IN'P. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY - REVERSE ANGLE ON VIDEOTAPE
Blurry image of the men in the room. Tony is not that
clear an image as he glances briefly, uninterested, into the camera.

TONY
Yeah, is that what you jerk off in front of Seidelbaum?

NICK
Oh shit and I was supposed to meet this chick at three. What a pain in the ass.

SEIDELBAUM
(to camera)
Okay, Danny, turn it off.
The angle goes black.

SEIDELBAUM
(reciting the Miranda)
All right, Montana, you have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can be taken against you. You have the....

TONY
(cuts him off)
I know all that shit, Seidelbaum, save your breath. It ain't gonna
stick. You know it, I know it. I'm here changing dollar bills is all.
So you wanna waste everybody's time here, I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami. He's so good tomorrow morning you're gonna be working in Alaska, Seidelbaum....

CUT TO
165 XNT. TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 165

Tony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts his
hair. A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,
goes out. It's the first time we sense he might be using
the stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.

CUT TO

166 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Tony is pacing nervously. Manny looks on. Red-headed
Sheffield rasps through a cloud of cigarette smoke behind
his desk.

SHEFFIELD
. ..you give me a check for a hundred grand plus three hundred in cash and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge. But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion -- and they'll get it.

TONY
What am I looking at?

SHEFFIELD
Five years, you'll be out in three, maybe less if I can make a deal.

TONY
For what! Three years in the can!
For washing money? This whole country's built out of washed money!

MANNY
Hey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.

Tony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an
epileptic fit.

SHEFFIELD
I'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.

TONY
No...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

SHEFFIELD
Tony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.

Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
Sheffield's desk.

TONY
All right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell
you about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?
I'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.

Pause.

SHEFFIELD
(cool)
The point is made. Now where's the money?

Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
desk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
hands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.

167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167
Camera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside
gallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with
several other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their
coffee after lunch.

SOSA
(rising)
Tony...Tony.

TONY
Alex.

They hug like they were the closest of friends.

SOSA
I'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?

TONY
She's okay. How's your wife?

SOSA
Three more months.

TONY
That's great.

SOSA
And you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.

TONY
(sore point)
I'm working on it.

SOSA
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.

They laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with
him than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.

SOSA
Tony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.

He smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.

SOSA
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.

PEDRO QUINN
A pleasure, Mr. Montana.

Camera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music
assuming a faint martial stride.

SOSA
General Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.

The man is in civilian clothes.

SOSA
Ariel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.

The cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who
nailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-
type in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.

SOSA
Charles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.

TONY
Hi....

GOODSON
How do you do, Mr. Montana...

He smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.

SOSA
Nicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.

The black aide goes.

SOSA
(solicitous)
Tony, come, please sit here.

Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
surrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the
proceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.

He suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
moving with another woman past a window of the house. Then
she's gone.

Sosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching
knees.

SOSA
Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....

TONY
Sure, Alex.

SOSA
Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.

Tony waits.

SOSA
We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....

Pause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
gaze away.

TONY
And your problem, Alex?

Sosa looks around, stands up.

SOSA
Come, I'll show you.

Tony cautiously stands to follow him.

CUT TO
168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168
MATOS STUDY
A ""Phil Donahue-type"" setting. A segment now in progress
with the ""Donahue-type"" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.
Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion.

GUTIERREZ
More than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It
sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!

INTERVIEWER
I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.

GUTIERREZ
The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,
Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.

INTERVIEWER
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

GUTIERREZ
(laughs)
Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --

Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV
screen, dour, ruthless.

GUTIERREZ
. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?

Laughter.

169 TONY 169
watching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from
the coke usage.

SOSA
A Communist -- financed by Moscow.

170 GUTIERREZ 170
holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the
TV screen.

GUTIERREZ
...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....

INTERVIEWER
What are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?

GUTIERREZ
(passionate)
The United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.

171 TONY 171
staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.

GUTIERREZ
You Americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....

Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.

SOSA
...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...
That's our problem.

TONY
Yeah.

Sosa looks up.

The Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into
the room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over
Tony. The Skull leads him in.

SOSA
You've met Alberto before?...

TONY
(remains seated)
Sure. How could I forget?

SOSA
Alberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.

Alberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.

SOSA
(to Tony)
So you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...
(*en)
Is that a problem, Tony?

Tony looks around the faces, then:

TONY
That's no problem, Alex....

Alex nods, pleased.
Hold on Tony. He blows his nose again.

175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT
A millionaire's place, like ""The Forge"" on Arthur Godfrey
Road. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.

TONY
Hey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.

Vic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--
cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a
patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.

VIC
Oh, is that so?

TONY
Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?

VIC
Aren't you... Tony Montana?

TONY
(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)
Yeah, that's me.

The half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.

TONY
(waves to them)
Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.

Waves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.

MANNY
(reproving)
Hey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....

TONY
I don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!

Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
of an anguish he does not understand.

CUT TO

173 TONY
sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....

MANNY
So what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?

TONY
Lot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.
The whole world's turning into politics.

He pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.

MANNY
The one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.

TONY
Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?

Manny remembers.

TONY
No free rides in this world, kid.

MANNY
So who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?

ELVIRA
What guy?

TONY
(to Manny)
You stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.

He takes a hit, unnoticed.

ELVIRA
(unheard)
What guy?

MANNY
(to Tony)
I don't like it.

TONY
You don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

What's Seidelbaum got to do with this?
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
Elvira's untouched plate.

TONY
Why don't you eat your food, what's
wrong with it?

ELVIRA
I'm not hungry.

She quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-
ment of her hand.

TONY
So what'd you order it for?

ELVIRA
I lost my appetite.

She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.

MANNY
(trying to shift the mood)
So what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....

Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.

TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
Is that what it's all about?

MANNY
It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....

TONY
(doesn't hear)
. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?
(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)
A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!

MANNY
(gently)
Tony, you're drunk.

TONY
...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it
man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!

Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.

ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!

They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.

ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!

The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVIRA
. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons
around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?
(in a softer tone)
Oh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...

Silence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's
this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
their lines.

TONY
(softly)
Go on, get a cab home, you're stoned.
(to Manny)
Manny.

ELVIRA
No, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't
even know it.

TONY
All right I'm stoned.

MANNY
(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)
Come on, baby.

ELVIRA
No, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...
(staring at Tony)
I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.

Pause. She starts wobbling out.
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.

TONY
Let her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.

Stumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.
Tony's eyes follow her. Pause.

The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
food, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food
and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

TONY
You're all assholes. You know why?
Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.

He wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony
shakes him loose.

TONY
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.

He starts out, staggers.

TONY
So say good night to the bad guy...
You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.

He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
and delight.

CUT TO
174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT
A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
moves into frame.

Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
under the car.

Tony looks:

175 ERNIE
down the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying
traffic, signals okay.

176 CHI-CHI
waits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.

Tony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
snort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
under.

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
axle of the car.

177 ERNIE
signals.

178 TONY
sees it.

A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
towards us.

Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
Tony hurries to the car, bends down.

TONY
(Spanish)
Psst! La Jara! Apaga.

The Shadow douses it and freezes in position.

Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.

Tony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.

TONY
Hey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?
Jesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.

FEMALE COP
Why don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....

TONY
The ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?

FEMALE COP
(in a hurry)
Look it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.
(signal to her partner, they drive off)

Tony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to
the car, bangs on the hood several times.

TONY
Hey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!

178 CONTINUED 178
Pause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.
gun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's
a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck you doing!

TONY
(winks)
Hey that was close, hunh?

CUT TO
179 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - DAY - EARLY NEXT MORNING 179
Ernie, Chi-Chi, and the Shadow huddle cold and uncomfortable in the sedan, waiting -- eating pizzas and drinking beers. The morning has come down ice cold.

180 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK - DAY 180
At the phone booth up corner, Tony -- the unshaven, bleary-eyed -- is rapping on the phone.

TONY
. . . Yeah, _ yeah...nah, nah...you tell Sheffield keep his nose out of it, there's not gonna be no trial, I got everything under control, yeah... Have you heard from Elvira?

He waits, hangs up, snorts some more, impatient. He picks up the phone again, starts dialing.

181 INT. TONY'S NEW YORK SEDAN - DAY 18:
In the sedan, the Shadow peers over, angry, at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck's he doing now! That sonufabitch....

182 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK r DAY 18;
In the booth, Tony, snorting another nostril, moves back
and forth as the phone rings at the other end. Finally she
picks up.

ELVIRA'S VOICE
Yes?

TONY
Hello baby, how's Baltimore?..hey look Elvie, I been thinkin' 'bout us, you know and....

The phone goes dead. Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.

183 OMITTED 183

184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184
He gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him
with the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back. Tony, seemingly unaffected by the weather, reaches for an open pint of ice cream, starts eating it with a plastic spoon.
He alternates ice cream with coke through the scene;the
dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half-eaten
Chinese food.

The Shadow, disgusted with all this mess, restrains himself,
staring out at the street with a hate-filled expression,
saying nothing.

CHI-CHI
(concerned)
Everything okay Tony?

TONY
Yeah roses. Where is this fuckin' guy?
I don't got all day to piss away.

CHI-CHI
Probably fucking his wife.
(eating pizza)
Jeezus it's cold.

185 THEIR POINT OF VIEW THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
The door of the brownstone. No movement. Though now
there's increasing traffic on the street and passing pedestrians.

TONY
. . . we oughta shoot him when he comes
out the door, save a lotta bullshit.

186 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

CHI -CHI
What's so important about this guy anyway? What's he, a Communist?

TONY
(snorting through his mouth)
Nah he's no Communist. He's a kinda symbol, that's what he is.

CHI-CHI
What the fuck's that mean -- symbol?

TONY
It's like when you die, your life meant something to somebody, y'know? It wasn't like you just lived it for yourself, but you did something for the rest of the human race too...

Tony snorts another line -- seen through the rearview mirror.

CHI-CHI
(nods his head somberly)
Yeah?

TONY
Me, I wanna die fast. With my name written in lights all over the sky. Tony Montana. He died doin' it.

CHI-CHI
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony, you ain't gonna die.

TONY
(doesn't hear him)
...So I'll end up in a coffin. So what? The cockroach fires the bullet's gonna end up in a coffin just like me. But I lived better when I was here. And that's what counts.

Pause.

TONY
(nervous, to Ernie)
Ernie, what time?

ERNIE
Ten to.

TONY
(opening his door)
I gotta call Manny.

He starts out the door. The Shadow barks out something in
preemptory Spanish.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Sit down!

TONY
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, you,...

CHI-CHI
Tony, he's coming!

187 EXT. MATOS' STREET - DAY
Tony looks around, sees:
Matos coming out the door, briefcase in hand.

Tony gets back in the car.

188 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos gets into his sedan a quarter block down from his front door.

189 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony staring.
The Shadow, most excited of all, like a panther that just
spotted his prey, eyes alive for the first time.

191 XNT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

SHADOW
(Spanish, excited)
...The UN -- right in front of it.
In the daylight. That's the way they want it.

Tony breaks open a fresh vial.

TONY
(English)
Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like.

The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who
doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.

SHADOW
(Spanish; to Chi-Chi)
What's he saying! You tell him stay inside thirty metres of the car okay -- no more you just stay inside thirty metres.

TONY
(English)
Hey, okay, I heard you the the first time. One time okay. Just tell me one time.
(snorts)

SHADOW
(Spanish)
I tell you thirty metres okay! You understand, madre de dios, why this hop-head is driving!

CHI-CHI
Okay, okay.

TONY
(English)
Okay, okay, cool it willya, all right.

192 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos pulls his car out of the parking space.

Tony puts his car in gear, prepares to pull out when:

Matos stops his car, backs up -- in the direction of his front door.

TONY
What the ---

Matos comes to a halt, double-parked, honks.

193 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
What's he doing? Where's he going?

194 MATOS' BROWNSTONE - SIDEWALK - DAY
The wife opens the door, steps out -- followed, moments
later, by two schoolchildren, books in hand. Matos waves
to them to come along.

195 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony looks astonished, back at Chi-Chi.

TONY
What the fuck! You said the wife took `em in the other car.

CHI-CHI
She did boss. She did it every fuckin' day, I swear!

196 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 196
The two children are now climbing in the back of Matos'
sedan, the wife getting into the pasenger seat. They drive off.

197 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 19:
Tony, upset now, goes to his vial, snorts, turns sharply to
the Shadow.

TONY
Hey Chico, no fuckin' way! No wife, no kids! We hit this fuckin' guy we hit him alone okay.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now.
We do it.

He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos,
muttering to himself.

TONY
...aw fuck this, this fuckin' asshole!

Chi-Chi, in the back, looks on worried.

198 NEW YORK STREETS - DAY - FOLLOWING MATOS' SEDAN
through Manahattan, towards the UN.

The Shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder. He now sticks a key in it. A red light pulses at intervals.

Tony, driving, glances, the tension building in him, he
does another giant snort.

Matos' sedan, swerving out into traffic to pass a car, has
a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.

The Shadow goes nuts, peering over the dashboard to see if
the bomb came loose.

SHADOW
(to himself, Spanish)
Madre de dios, my bomb! -- don't you fuckin' fall, my little baby!
Perspiration starting to break out on his forehead.

Tony also feels the sweat coming on.

TONY
(muttering)
...this is fuckin' crazy, man, this is sloppy doing it this way, you
don't do it like this....

He honks furiously at a cab that tries to cut him off.

199 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony, intense at the wheel, sneezing, his nose running.

SHADOW
(equally tense, in Spanish)
You're losing them! There! That street, they go that street!

TONY
I see 'im! I see `im!

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Thirty metres! Thirty metres! Go! Go!

TONY
Shut the fuck up!
Honking like a madman and accelerating past a truck....

TONY
...what am I doing? What the fuck am I doing here?...

sedan pulling off at 47th and Second Avenue heading
Mato's

end of the street.

201 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 20:
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Okay, now...now. Right here.
Easy. Easy!
The decoder.

Tony snorts.

TONY
(muttering)
Aw, fuck you, you fuckin' vulture....

The Shadow in stark profile.
His finger depresses the first key of the decoder.

UNDER MATOS' CAR - DAY

The bomb -- pulsing red light.

203 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 203
The Gutierrez sedan pulls off the sidestreet into the thick
of First Avenue traffic -- approaching the striking facade
of the United Nations.

204 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 204
The Shadow is in a full sweat.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
...okay, okay, nice 'n' easy...at the corner... when he pulls up at the corner.

His finger hovering around the second key of the decoder.

Chi-Chi in the back, leaning forward across the seat.

TONY
(muttering)
Two kids in the car, Jesus Christ!

205 UNDER GUTIERREZ' CAR - DAY 205
The bomb -- jarred by -a bump, pulsing red light.

206 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 206
Gutierrez' sedan inches its way out of the traffic and eases along the curb.

207 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 207
Tony honking his way through traffic after them, building
to a climax with himself.

TONY
(muttering)
...bunch of fuckin' vultures. You don't have the guts to look 'im in the eye when you kill him, you gotta hide, you fuckin' vulture.

Honk, honk.

SHADOW
Shut up!

CHI-CHI
(suddenly panicked)
He's gonna get out! Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

TONY
(ignoring all the commotion)
makes you feel good, hunh?
Killing the wife and the kids. Big man. Well fuck you! What do you
think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman. Well fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life.

His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Beretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, leveling it on the Shadow.

TONY
Motherfucker!

The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps
two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.

CHI-CHI
Oh Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the....

Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic
around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as
the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday
morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered
up against a passenger window and nobody really sees...
except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she
wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.

TONY
(continuing to mutter)
...so what'd you think I was, hunh?
A fucking worm like you! I told you don't fuck with me! I told you no kids! You shoulda listened to me you stupid fuck!

Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
on them.

TONY
Ernie? Where the fuck you been?

ERNIE'S VOICE
I had a delivery. Tony, everything go okay, whatsa ---

TONY
Fuck no? Where the hell's Manny? I been calling all over.

ERNIE'S VOICE.
I don't know, Tony. He's been gone last couple of days. Didn't say nothing.

TONY
What! Where! I left that sunufabitch in charge! What the hell is going on here, can't I trust anybody anymore.

ERNIE'S VOICE
I don't know, Tony, he just took off, y'know, he didn't say nothing...
you all right?

TONY
No, I'm not all right. I'm pissed off! And when I 'get there I'm gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin' place!

ERNIE'S VOICE
When you coming back, Tony?

TONY
Tonight!
(repeating to himself)
Where the hell is that cocksucker?
I can't trust nobody no more. You think just cause I'm a nice guy....

ERNIE'S VOICE
Uh, Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone. She got to see you right away.

TONY
Gina's gone? Where! Oh fuck! ...Tell her I'll be there tonight. Okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Right.

TONY
(about to hang up, pauses)
uh -- how 'bout Elvie -- did she call?

ERNIE'S VOICE
(a beat)
No.

TONY
Yeah, okay, okay... listen if she calls, tell her I love her, okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Yeah, okay Tony.

Tony hangs up. A moment of despair. Then he snorts
another spoon and snaps back.

213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213
Ernie meets them at the door.

TONY
Hear from Manny?

ERNIE
No Tony. Your mama called again.
She gotta see you. And Sosa's been ringing every half-hour on the eleven line. Tony, he sounds pissed, he....

TONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Chi-Chi, get him on the line. In the office.

Chi-Chi goes.

TONY
What about Elvie -- anything?

Ernie shakes his head.

TONY
You keep trying Manny. I need that cocksucker, you hear, I need him here! Okay?

ERNIE
Right, Tony.

Tony stalks off, towards his office.

214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE

Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
and stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

TONY
Yeah? Hi. Mami.

Her voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.
The other phone is ringing.
Not really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.

Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.

TONY
(into the phone)
Yeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!
No problem, okay.

He hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.
The telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.

TONY
. . . so whaddaya say Alex?

Pause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very
cold.

SOSA'S VOICE
So what happened Tony?

TONY
(casual)
Oh we had some problems.

SOSA'S VOICE
Yeah, I heard.

TONY
How'd you hear?

SOSA'S VOICE
Cause our friend gave a speech today at the UN. He wasn't supposed to give that speech.

TONY
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, your guy Alberto was apiece of shit, he didn't do what I
said so I cancelled his fuckin' contract.

Pause at the other end.

SOSA'S VOICE
e . . M-y partners and I are pissed off.

TONY
Hey Alex, no big deal. There's plenty other 'Albertos'. So I'll
deliver the goods next month.

SOSA'S VOICE
(suddenly angry and letting Tony know)
No! We can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony. And our friend's got security now up the ass. And the heat's coming down hard on me and my partners.
There's not gonna be a next time. You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!

TONY
Hey, you don't talk to me like that!
Who do you ---

SQSA' S VOICE
(simultaneous)
I told you a long time ago, you little fuckin' monkey, not to fuck me and....

Tony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.

TONY
Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think
I am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re
shit! You want a war, you got it?

Slams the phone down.

TONY
The fucking nerve of that guy!

In the cavernous silence of the room, he listlessly turns to another line of coke.

215 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 215
Tony in the backseat in his white Corniche staring straight
ahead. Ernie driving, Chi-Chi with him.

216 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - NIGHT 216
The bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi
getting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
You try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.

He hurries towards the house.

217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:
Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
previously, as if overwhelmed by events.

MAMA
. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.

TONY
The Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?

You ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....

TONY
I never gave her that kinda money.

MAMA
Yes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...

TONY
Mama, was there a guy with hex?

MAMA
I don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....

Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
by the shoulders.

TONY
Where's this house, tell me!

MAMA
Citrus Drive. Four hundred something.
Four hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
Exactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.

He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.

MAMA
Don't you see what you do to her?
Don't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....

TONY
(shakes himself loose, turns on her)
No! You know why she left, Mama?
Not cause of me. Cause of you.

MAMA
Me?

TONY
Yeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Nagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?

TONY
(continuing)
...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --
never good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!

MAMA
(interrupts)
. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....

TONY
First time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .

MAMA
Where was I?

TONY
...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.
I hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?

MAMA
(interrupts)
You ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....

TONY
That's right! That's right. What did you expect!

MAMA
(interrupts)
.that's what you brought into this
i&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....

TONY
What do you expect now? To be loved?
You got no love in you, Mama.
What do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Somebody? You're proud? You're a
(Escoria!)
nothing. You're an animal!

Tony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.

MAMA
God help me, what have I done to you?
You were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....

Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.

218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218
Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly
closing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips
open her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the
doorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony
takes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.
CUT TO

219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219
Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies
the house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,
not calling attention to itself.

Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the
crystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
Wait here.

He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.
Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.

MANNY
(surprised)
Tony?

Tony stares, stunned.
Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a
big smile of welcome for her brother.

GINA
Tony!
(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)

Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.

Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.

MANNY
Hey Tony, c'mon we was....

The gun fires.

GINA
Tony! No!

Tony fires a second time.
Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.

Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
Manny lies at his feet, dead.

GINA
Manny!

She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.

GINA
Manny!

She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.

GINA
You killed him?

Shaking her head at him incredulously.

GINA
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.

Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.

GINA
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?
What'd he do?

She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes
horrible strangled sounds with her throat.

Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.

CHI-CHI
Tony, come on. We gotta get out of here
(to Gina)
Come on baby...Gina!

Suddenly she goes berserk.

GINA
Noooooooooooo!

And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.

Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.

220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220
Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.

Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
the pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.

ERNIE
(to Chi-Chi)
Get the body!

Tony, back at the door, looks down again.
The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.

Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.

CHI-CHI
Tony!

Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.

TONY
Yeah!

He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.
Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.

The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.

GINA
Manny! ...Manny! No!

CUT TO -
221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221
The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.

222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222
It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,
gravel flying.

The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the
shadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.
Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.

223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223

Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the front
door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting
for them at the door.

Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.

CHI-CHI
What do we do with her Tony?

TONY
Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
Put her in my bedroom.
(to Gina)
It'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take
care of you....

She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.
They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.

224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224
Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.

Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.

CHI-CHI
We got some pills into her, she's cooling down.

Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.
Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.
Pause as he lets it sink in.

CHI-CHI
(worried)
Boss, what we gonna do now?

TONY
Do? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.
We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that
fucker down.

Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.

CHI-CHI
(eyeing the coke)
Hey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?

Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.
Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.

Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.

CUT TO
225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225
The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.
A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.
The monkeys listen quietly.
The flamingoes flutter.
. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...

. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.
. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
balustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically
catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

TONY
(insensate)
. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....

His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.
Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!

TONY
...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...
Well what the hell happened, hunh?
What the hell happened to us?...

In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:

The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring
out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.

Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.

A third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate.

On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
incoherent.

TONY
...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would
you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...

As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:

TONY
...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....


226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226
As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.
Tony sees her.
She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.

GINA
Is this what you want Tony?...

Tony shocked.

GINA
You can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.

She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.

The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.

GINA
I'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.

Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.

GINA
Come and get me Tony. Before it's too late.

He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.

GINA
Come on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---

ERNIE
Get outta here!
Tony, they're everywhere!

Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.

TONY
(gently)
Hey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.

Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.

TONY tx:
Come on Gina, get off the floor.
You're all dirty now, you need a bath...
Mami's gonna be angry baby
-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..
Come on open your eyes my baby,
open your eyes.. -give me a smile.

There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
pounding it.

CHI-CHI
Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!

On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
goes off, blows him up against the door.

TONY
Cheeee!

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.

On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.

Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,
talking to himself.

TONY
So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.

Karroooomph!
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.
It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.

Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

TONY
Whores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?

Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

TONY
Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!

Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
away. Laughing like a madman.

TONY
You need an army you hear! An army to kill me!

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

The Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.

Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below.

He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.

As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.

The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:
""THE WORLD IS YOURS""
And so, for the brief moment, it was.

Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word ""Chivato"" in blood on the outside walls,
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay

Draft script.

INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The
wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
""Sit."" Craig opens the book. It reads: ""sit sit sit sit
sit..."" over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
He looks at the book again. It is now entitled ""Die."" He
opens it up. ""die die die die die..."" A rooster crows.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for
work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.

LOTTE
Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
Hatch was out of his pen. Good
morning.

Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

CRAIG
Morning.

LOTTE
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
coming in first thing.

CRAIG
Enjoy.

LOTTE
Craig, listen, honey, I've been
thinking... maybe you'd feel better
if you got, you know, a job or
something.

CRAIG
We've been over this. Nobody's
looking for a puppeteer in today's
wintry economic climate.
LOTTE
Well, you know, maybe something else
until this whole puppet thing turns
around.

CRAIG
(bitterly)
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
job.

LOTTE
(sighs)
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
(beat)
Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
a favor?

CRAIG
What?

LOTTE
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
to be a little under the weather this
morning.

CRAIG
Which one is Elijah again?
LOTTE
The monkey.

CRAIG
Yeah. Okay.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet
version of Craig. The ""Craig"" puppet paces back and forth,
wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
the real Craig's brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the
background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
The assembled crowd is enthralled.

TV ANNOUNCER
The crowd is enthralled as Derek
Mantini, arguably the greatest
puppeteer in the history of the
world, performs ""The Belle of
Amherst"" with his 60 foot Emily
Dickinson puppet, directed by the
inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

CHARLES NELSON REILLY
Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

CRAIG
Gimmicky bastard.

Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs
his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

MUSIC IN: TRIUMPHANT

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Craig searches through Lotte's closet, looking for the
right dress.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BATHROOM - DAY

Craig waxes his body, shaves his face.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Craig paints his nails while he chats on the phone. Craig
pulls stockings and underwear from Lotte's drawer. Craig
picks a wig from a mannequin head on Lotte's dressing table.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Craig, at the sewing machine, is sewing padding to go onto
his chest and around his hips.

CUT TO:

Craig applies make up in the bathroom mirror.

CUT TO:

Why'd you do it, Craig?

CRAIG
I'm a puppeteer.

They drive in silence.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Craig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the

thought, stands with determination.

MUSIC IN: SAME AS BEFORE.

dexterous fingers needed for speed filing."" Craig writes
down the address.

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings
board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on
floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits.
Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open,
and Craig and the other man get in.

CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The other man presses ""9."" Craig studies the buttons. There
is no ""7 1/2.""

MAN #1
Seven and a half, right?

CRAIG
Uh. yeah.

MAN #1
I'll take you through it.

The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He
watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After
""7"" and before ""8"", the man hits the emergency stop button.
The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors
with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building
hallway, except that from floor to ceiling it is only about
four feet high. Everything is scaled down accordingly.
The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2.

MAN #1
Seven and a half.

CRAIG
Thank you.

Craig climbs out onto the 7 1/2 floor.

CUT TO:

INT. SEVEN AND A HALF FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Craig, hunched-over, makes his way down the hallway
looking for LesterCorp. He passes a hunched-over man
walking in the other direction. They nod to each other.
Craig finds a door marked ""LesterCorp - Meeting America's
Filing Needs Since 1922."" He enters.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTERCORP RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

All furniture is scaled down to fit into this low-ceilinged
space. A few other short men sit reading tiny magazines.
Craig approaches Floris, the receptionist.

FLORIS
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet
your filing needs?

CRAIG
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz.
I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

FLORIS
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...

CRAIG
Schwartz.

FLORIS
Pardon?

CRAIG
Schwartz.

FLORIS
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

CRAIG
My name is Schwartz.

FLORIS
Money, Miss Warts?

CRAIG
Forget it.

Craig takes a seat next to the other applicants.

FLORIS
(calling across the room)
Fork ah did?

The intercom buzzes. Floris picks it up.

FLORIS
(to Craig)
Mr. Juarez?

CRAIG
Yes?

FLORIS
Yex?

CRAIG
I said ""yes.""

FLORIS
You suggest what? I have no time for
piddling suggestions from mumbling job
applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr.
Lester will see you now. I think
that's what he said.

Craig stands, opens Lester's door, and enters.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Craig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched
behind his tiny desk.

LESTER
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but,
well, you know.

CRAIG
(extending his hand)
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,
Dr. Lester.

Lester flips an intercom switch.

LESTER
Security.

CRAIG
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
your secretary.

LESTER
She's not my secretary. She's what
they call an executive liaison, and
I'm not banging her, if that's what
you're implying.

CRAIG
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
misspoke.

LESTER
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

CRAIG
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

LESTER
(crafty)
You think so, eh? Which comes first,
L or... Glooph?

CRAIG
Glooph is not a letter, sir.

LESTER
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick
you. Okay, put these in order.

Lester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders
them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches,
eyes wide.

LESTER (CONT'D)
(flips intercom switch)
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

FLORIS (O.S.)
Gehginnis ondah foam?

LESTER
Forget it.

FLORIS (CONT'D)
Fork ah did?

LESTER
(flips off switch)
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how
she puts up with this damn speech
impediment of mine.

CRAIG
You don't have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester.

LESTER
Flattery will get you everywhere,
my boy. But I'm afraid I have to
trust Floris on this one. You see,
she has her doctorate in speech
impedimentology from Case Western.
Perhaps you've read her memoirs,
""I can't understand a word any of
you are saying.""

CRAIG
No.

LESTER
Pity, it tells it like it is.
That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
publishing establishment won't touch
it. That's a quote from the book
jacket. George Will, I think.
(beat)
I apologize if you can't understan
a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

CRAIG
No. I understand perfectly.

LESTER
(choking up)
Thank you for being kind enough to
lie. You see, I've been very lonely
in my isolated tower of
indecipherable speech. You're hired.
Any questions?

CRAIG
Just one. Why is this floor so short?

LESTER
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the
savings on to you.
(laughs heartily)
But seriously, that's all covered in
orientation.

CUT TO:

INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY

It's a small screening room with red velvet seats. There
are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig
is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest
momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close
cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face
expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances
over at Craig, then turns back to the screen. The lights
dim. A projector whirs and the screen is illuminated.

CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

We tilt up the building.

TITLE: The 7 1/2 Floor

NARRATOR (0.S.)
Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the
Mertin-Flemmer building. As you
will now be spending your work day
here, it is important that you learn
a bit about the history of this
famous floor.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY

Don and Wendy, two office workers, crouch in the hall and
chat. Both hold cups of coffee.

WENDY
Hello, Don.

DON
Hello. Wendy.

WENDY
Don, I was wondering, do you know
why our workplace has such low
ceilings?

DON
It's an interesting story, Wendy.
Many years ago in the late 1800's,
James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
looking to invest in the future of
our great country, came to this town
and decided to erect an office
building.

CUT TO:

OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.

DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
He would call this building the
Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
himself and someone else, who, local
legend has it, was named Flemmer.

CUT TO:

INT. 19TH CENTURY OFFICE - DAY

An actor playing Mertin sits at a desk and writes with
aquill. He appears very stern and has mutton chop
sideburns.

DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
One day. Captain Mertin received an
unexpected visitor.

There is a knock at the door.

MERTIN
Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

A tiny woman enters.

TINY WOMAN
Captain Mertin?

MERTIN
What want ye, girl child?

TINY WOMAN
I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
but rather an adult lady of miniature
proportions.

MERTIN
(taken aback)
I see. Well, it is not my fault that
thou art tiny. So if it is charity
yer after, then be gone with ye,
ye foul demon.

TINY WOMAN
I am not asking for alms, but rather
the ear of a kind man with a noble
heart.

MERTIN
(sighs)
Aye. Speak then if ye must.

TINY WOMAN
Captain Mertin, surely I am a
God-fearing Christian woman like
yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
the world was not built with me in
mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
lady, Captain. after all, who would
marry a person of my diminutiveness?
So I am forced to work for my few
pennies a week as an optometrist.
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work safe and comfortable?

Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

MERTIN
Woman, your story moves me like n
other. Me own sister was tiny and
then died. Therefore, I shall make
ye me wife. And I shall build a
floor in my building, between the
7th and 8th, which will be scaled
down, so from now on there shall
be at least one place on God's green
Earth that you and your accursed
kind can live in peace...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY

Don And Wendy crouch and talk.

DON
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since
the rents are considerably lower
this floor has been adopted by
businesses which for one reason
or another are forced to cut corners
After all... the overhead is low!
Ha ha ha!

WENDY
Ha ha ha!

TITLE: The End

CUT TO:

INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY

The screen goes dark. The lights go up. Craig looks over
at Maxine. She stands and walks past him.

CRAIG
Moving story.

MAXINE
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit.
The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil
that it could never be revealed
to Americans raised on sitcoms and
happy news anchors.

CRAIG
Is that true?

MAXINE
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't
it?.

CRAIG
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just
starting out at LesterCorp.

MAXINE
How dreary - to be - Somebody /
How public - like a Frog /
To tell one's name - the livelong June /
To an admiring Bog!

CRAIG

MAXINE
I wouldn't know.

Maxine walks away.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lotte chops onions. A parrot sits on her head. Craig stirs
a pot on the stove. A monkey leaps from the top of the
cabinet to the top of the refrigerator to the kitchen table.
A dog watches the monkey and barks at it.

PARROT
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

CRAIG
Shut up!

LOTTE
(to Craig)
Sorry, honey.

The dog continues to bark.

PARROT
Sorry honey. Sorry honey.

An offscreen neighbor pounds the wall.

NEIGHBOR (0.S.)
Shut up!

LOTTE
(yelling)
Sorry!

Lotte grabs the parrot off her head and leaves the room.

PARROT (0.S.)
Help! She's locking me in a cage!

Lotte reenters.

LOTTE
Isn't that cute? I just taught her
that.

CRAIG
Adorable. What time are they supposed
to be here?

LOTTE
Seven-ish

CRAIG
We have to make it an early night.

LOTTE
They'll understand. Besides I've got
a morning appointment tomorrow with
Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the
bottom of this acid stomach.

CRAIG
(not paying attention)
Hmmm.

LOTTE
Some sort of childhood trauma, she
thinks. Possible feelings of
inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting,
huh?

CRAIG
Hmmm.

The doorbell rings. The dog barks. The parrot screams.
The neighbor pounds on the wall.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their
friends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner. There
is an obvious lull in the conversation.

PETER
Good food, Lotte.

LOTTE
Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the
way.

PETER
Vegetarian, right?

LOTTE
Yes. All vegetable. all the time.

PETER
Amazing.

There is another lull. Everyone eats.

PETER (CONT'D)
No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor.
Craig?

CRAIG
No kidding, Peter.

GLORIA
That's great. It almost sounds like
make-believe.
(beat)
Like a storybook.
(beat)
like a fairy tale.
(beat)
It's really great.
(beat)
So Lotte, when you say all vegetable,
do you mean all vegetable entire1y?

CUT TO:

INT. PETER AND GLORIA'S CAR - NIGHT

Gloria and Peter drive in silence.

GLORIA
Lotte told me that Eskimos have a
lot of words for snow.

PETER
How many?

GLORIA
Ten, I think.

PETER
I wonder why so many.

GLORIA
Because they have a lot of snow.
Isn't that interesting?

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Craig washes the dishes. Lotte dries them. They don't
look at each other.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTERCORP FILE ROOM - MORNING

Craig in a cream colored suit, pours over the file cabinets.
Floris watches from the doorway.

FLORIS
You're good.

Craig turns.

CRAIG
(over-enunciating)
Thank you, Floris.

Floris shrugs, shakes her head.

FLORIS
You're not like the other boys
we've had here. Granted, I can't
understand what you're saying either,
but your soft palette resonates
tremendously well and you never
ever constrict your epiglottis.

CRAIG
I am a trained performer.

FLORIS
(swooning)
Music to my ears! Whatever you said.
Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent
friend, speak!

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY

Craig pours himself a cup of coffee. Maxine approaches
with an empty cup.

CRAIG
Hello again.

Craig fills her cup.

MAXINE
Yes, well...

CRAIG
You know, I've been thinking about
what you said yesterday, about the
orientation film being a cover-up.
I think you're on to something.

MAXINE
And fifty other lines to get into
a girl's pants.

CRAIG
No, really.

MAXINE
You know, if you ever got me, you
wouldn't have a clue what to do
with me. That's the thing, Romeo.

Maxine walks away.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

Craig is at his workbench, painting the finishing touches
on a new puppet. It is beautiful. It is Maxine. Lotte
watches quietly from the door. A Lotte puppet hangs
from a hook, tangled and dusty.

LOTTE
New puppet?

Craig is surprised, caught.

CRAIG
Yeah, just an idea I had.

LOTTE
She's very beautiful.

CRAIG
(shrugging)
Just an idea I had.

Craig hangs the puppet, stands, and switches off the light.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
C'mon, let's go to bed.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark. Lotte snores lightly. Craig lies there
with his eyes open. Quietly, he gets up and leaves the
bedroom. Lotte watches him go.

CUT TO:

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Craig stands above the puppet stage. He is working both the
Craig puppet and the Maxine puppet at the same time. The
two perform a beautiful and graceful pas de deux. They
finish in a passionate embrace.

CRAIG
(quietly)
I would too know what to do with you.

CUT TO:

INT. FILE ROOM - MORNING

Craig files. Floris watches him from the doorway. Dr.
Lester watches Floris from behind a cabinet.

FLORIS
Oh, what magic those fingers could
work on the right ""cabinet.""
(strokes Craig's neck)
Alphabetize me, baby. And don't
forget, I comes before U.

Floris laughs long and hard. Too long and too hard.

CRAIG
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm
afraid I'm in love with somebody
else.

FLORIS
(upset)
I'm afraid I... have no idea what
you are saying... you bastard!

Floris runs from the room. Lester pokes his head out from
behind the cabinet.

LESTER
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
Why, if I were eighty years younger,
I'd box your ears.

CRAIG
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I
was just... How old are you?

LESTER
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.
(beat)
Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost
not worth it. I piss orange. Oh,
and I, have to piss sitting down...
like a godamn girly... every fifteen
minutes. But nobody wants to die,
Schwartz.

CRAIG
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

LESTER
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what
I do is get older, wrinkled like a
former plum that's become the
wrinkled prune you see before you.
Oh, to be a young man again, maybe
then Floris would care for me.

CRAIG
The elderly have so much to offer,
sir. They are our link with history.

LESTER
I don't want to be your godamn link,
damn you. I want to feel Floris'
naked thighs against my own. I want
to know passion. I want my body to
inspire lust in that beautiful,
complex woman. I want her to shiver
in a spasm of ecstasy when I
penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony
of the flesh, Schwartz.

CRAIG
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that
you share your feelings with me, I
believe perhaps the workplace is not
the most suitable environment for
this type of discussion.

LESTER
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice
Juice Bar after work today and I'll
spill my goddamn guts for you.

Lester exits.

CRAIG
Shit.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY

Craig squats next to a payphone.

CRAIG
(into phone)
I won't be late. I just have to
listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a little
while. It's a job thing.

Maxine walks by. Craig grabs her arm, signals for her
to wait a minute. She waits.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
(into phone)
I gotta go back to work. Yeah,
okay. You too. Okay. Bye.

Craig hangs up.

MAXINE
What?

CRAIG
I just wanted to say ""hi."" Did
you know I still don't know your
name or where you work?

MAXINE
Yeah.

CRAIG
How about this, if I can guess your
first name within three tries, you
have to come out for a drink with me
tonight.

MAXINE
Why not?

CRAIG
Great.

MAXINE
Who told you?

CRAIG
I'm right?

MAXINE
Who told you?

CRAIG
That's incredible! Nobody told me!
I swear! It's kismet. Maxine!
It's a beautiful name. There's a
psychic connection. Don't you see?
It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine!
Maxine! I will shout it from the
rooftops!

MAXINE
Somebody told you.

CRAIG
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine,
Maxine. It just came out of me like
a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy,
song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!

MAXINE
I am dubious, but I don't welsh.
Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven
o'clock. You're late, I walk. So
help me, if I find out you cheated.

CRAIG
(in heaven)
Maxine.

Craig walks down the hall. A tiny smile flits across
Maxine's face.

CUT TO:

INT. JUICY JUICE BAR - EVENING

Lester and Craig sit at a table. There are several emptied
glasses of carrot juice in front of Lester. Craig nurses
one glass, and keeps checking his watch.

LESTER
Imagine a room full of women.
Nubile, blonde, wet with desire,
Schwartz. A harem, if you will.
Me in leather. A harness, if you
like. I am the object of this
desire, and all eyes are on me as
I speak. ""Ladies,"" I begin. ""I am
the love god, Eros. I intoxicate
you. My spunk is to you manna from
heaven...

CRAIG
(standing)
Dr. Lester, it's been really
fascinating, but I'm afraid I have
to get home to my wife now.

LESTER
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her,
Craig.

CRAIG
Yessir.

LESTER
Shall we say dinner on Friday.
Just the two of us?
(afterthought)
You can come too if you like,
Schwartz.

CRAIG
(checking watch)
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta
run.

Craig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice,
signals the waiter for more.

CUT TO:

INT. THE STUCK PIG - NIGHT

Maxine sits at the bar, watching her watch. Craig rushes
into the room, frantic, out of breath. He spots Maxine and
plops himself next to her.

CRAIG
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine,
Maxine.

MAXINE
Just.

CRAIG
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

MAXINE
You married?

CRAIG
Yeah. But enough about me.

Maxine laughs. The bartender approaches.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
What'll you have?

MAXINE
(to bartender)
The usual, Barry.

CRAIG
(to bartender)
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a
Budweiser, or something.

The bartender walks away.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
I like you. I don't know what it
is exactly.

MAXINE
My tits?

CRAIG
No, no, it's your energy or your
attitude or the way you carry
yourself or...

MAXINE
Christ, you're not a fag are you?
Because I don't want to be wasting
my time.

The drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of
a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows
swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an
plastic monkeys hang from the rim.

CRAIG
That's the usual?

MAXINE
Don't let the girly shit fool you.
It'd blow your shorts off.

Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the
empty glass to the bartender.

MAXINE (CONT'D)
Set me up again, Barry.

The bartender walks away with the empty glass.

CRAIG
I'm not a homosexual. I just like
women for more than their bodies.
I guess you could say I'm the new
American male.

MAXINE
You're a fag or a liar.

CRAIG
(backpedaling)
I mean, I am really attracted to
you.

MAXINE
(mocking)
I mean, I am really attracted to
you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can
share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

Maxine gets up.

CRAIG
(at a loss)
No, wait! I like your tits.
(beat)
I love your tits. I want to fuck
you.

MAXINE
(sitting)
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
(beat)
Not a chance.

Maxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the
glass toward the bartender.

MAXINE (CONT'D)
So, tell me about yourself. If you
can get your mind out of the gutter
long enough, dog-boy.

CRAIG
Well, I'm a puppeteer...

The bartender comes back with Maxine's drink.

MAXINE
(to bartender)
Check.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lotte is combing Elijah. Craig enters.

CRAIG
Hi.

LOTTE
Hi.

CRAIG
(nervous, talking too much)
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
wouldn't let me go. We're supposed
to have dinner with him on Friday.
I can get us out of it if you want.
He's really amazing, this insane old
lech. It's actually sort of amusing
when you get past just how disgusting
it is.

There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah.
Finally:

LOTTE
Did you eat?

CRAIG
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
didn't call. It was just, you know,
hard to get away.

LOTTE
I was worried.

CRAIG
I'm sorry. How was your evening?

LOTTE
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is
infected.

CRAIG
The ferret?

LOTTE
The iguana.

CRAIG
Right.

LOTTE
I dressed the wound. Then I've
just been feeding everyone, putting
everyone to bed.

CRAIG
Yeah. You want a beer?

LOTTE
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

CRAIG
All right. I'll be in my workshop
for a little while. I'll be in in
a little while. I need to unwind a

I'll be in soon. A little while.

LOTTE
'kay.

Lotte exits.

CUT TO:

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets
sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a
pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice.

CRAIG
(as Maxine, fascinated)
Tell me, Craig, why do you love
puppeteering?
(as Craig)
Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.
Being inside another skin. Moving
differently, thinking differently,
feeling differently.
(as Maxine)
Interesting. Would you like to be
inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
think? Feel what I feel?
(as Craig)
More than anything. Maxine.
(as Maxine)
It's good in here, Craig. Better
than your wildest dreams.

The puppets kiss.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY

Craig waits at the coffee machine. Checks his watch.
Finally Maxine approaches.

CRAIG
Hi.

MAXINE
You're not someone I could get
interested in. Craig. You play
with dolls.

CRAIG
(rehearsed)
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
of being inside someone else,
feeling what they feel, seeing
what they see...

MAXINE
Yikes.

CRAIG
Please, let me explain.

Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty
office.

CUT TO:

INT. EMPTY OFFICE - DAY

Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door.

CRAIG
It's just, and I've never done
this before, Maxine, but it's just
that I feel something for you. I've
never felt this before for anyone,
not even my wife. My future is with
you, Maxine.

MAXINE
You might want to check those tarot
cards one more time.

Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
it.

CRAIG
Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
floor.

Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a
dark and wet membranous tunnel inside.

CRAIG
Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love
this.

Craig lets go of the door and it slams shut.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - DAY

Lester sits at his desk studying an instruction manual for a
juicer. The spanking new juicer sits on his desk. There is an
urgent knocking at the door.

LESTER
Yes?

Craig rushes in.

CRAIG
Dr. Lester. . .

LESTER
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted
to see.
(proudly spreading his arms)
Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your
fingers clear of the blade, and
never, never use it while bathing in
a tub full of water.

CRAIG
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was
in that vacant office down the hall
and I stumbled upon a little door
and....

LESTER
Ah. yes, the little door.
(checks watch)
There is a short film on the little
door in the orientation room in
exactly two minutes. If you hurry,
you'll just make it.

CRAIG
Thank you, sir.

Craig exits. Lester waits a moment. then dials the phone.

LESTER
Put up reel 752.

CUT TO:

INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY

Craig sits in the otherwise empty screening room. The
lights dim, the film begins.

TITLE: THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE VACANT OFFICE

CUT TO:

INT. VACANT OFFICE - DAY

Wendy crouches in the vacant office and studies the closed
little door. Don enters. smiling.

DON
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in
this vacant office.

WENDY
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even
though I know it's against floor
policy. and I discovered that
there's a little tiny door in here.
Isn't it cute? It's almost like a
little dolly's door. I wonder what
it's for.

DON
(laughing)
That's right, Wendy, it is against
floor policy, but as long as you're
here, let me tell you what I know
about our cute little door friend.
Many years ago, this very office
was occupied by a kindly old
watchmaker named Mr. White.

DISSOLVE TO:

How cute!

They laugh.

TITLE: THE END

CUT TO:

INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY

The lights go up. Craig sits there for a moment. An usher
pushes a broom down the aisle.

CRAIG
Bullshit.

Craig exits. The usher mumbles something into a
walkie-talkie.

CUT TO:

INT. VACANT ROOM - DAY

Craig opens the little door and climbs into the
membranous hallway. The door slams shut behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

It's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous.
There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon
something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked
through a straw. There is a flash of light.

CUT TO:

INT. FANCY DINING ROOM - MORNING

The POV of someone reading a newspaper. The person lifts
a cup of coffee to his mouth. There is a slurping sound.
The person puts down the coffee cup and the newspaper, and
stands up.

CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.)
(losing his balance)
Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?

We're still in POV. The person walks across the room, picks
up his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and
checks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich.

CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.)
Holy shit! It's that actor guy.
Shit! What's his name? That actor
guy! What's happening? Am I
inside him? Am I in his brain?
Am I him? Is he me? Does he know
I'm here? My brain is reeling!
Is his brain reeling?

Malkovich walks to the front door, opens it, exits his
apartment.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Maxine sits at her desk, eats a sandwich. looks at a
fashion magazine, and chats on the phone.

MAXINE
The puppeteer told me he loves me

I know. I can't think of anything
more pathetic.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

John Malkovich's POV from the back seat of the cab. The
cab pulls away from the curb.

MALKOVICH (V.0.)

The Broadhurst Theater, please.

The cabbie studies Malkovich in his rearview mirror as he
drives.

CABBIE
Say, aren't you that actor guy?

MALKOVICH
Yeah.

CABBIE
John Makel...

CRAIG (V.0.)
John Malkovich! Of course!

CABBIE
Mapplethorpe?

MALKOVICH (V.0.)
Malkovich.

CABBIE
Malkovich!

CRAIG (V.0.)
John fucking Malkovich!

CABBIE
Yeah. I liked you in that one movie.

MALKOVICH (V.0.)
Thank you.

CABBIE
The one where you're that jewel
thief.

MALKOVICH
I never played a jewel thief.

CABBIE
Who am I thinking of?

MALKOVICH
I don't know.

CABBIE
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey,
could I get your autograph now?
It's for .... oh, what the hell,
it's for me! I'm your biggest
fan!

MALKOVICH
Yeah, okay.

The cabbie hands a pad back over the seat. Malkovich
reaches for it. There is a slurping sound.

CRAIG (V.0.)
(panicky)
Ahhhh!

The image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - DAY

It's on the side of Jersey Turnpike. There is a ""pop"" and
Craig falls from nowhere into the ditch. He is soaking wet,
and now dirty from the ditch. He stands, looks confusedly
around, sees a N.J. Turnpike sign. After a moment, he goes
to the side of the road and sticks out his thumb.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S OFFICE - LATER

Maxine sits behind her desk with her feet up, and talks on
the phone.

MAXINE
Absolutely, doll. I'm just about
to close up here.

Craig walks in disheveled and exhausted. Maxine sees him,
keeps talking.

MAXINE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Meet you at ""The Pig"" in twenty
minutes.
(laughs lasciviously)
Oh yeah, maybe I'll keep my legs
closed till then.
(hangs up. to Craig)
I'm splitting for the day. Lock up
for me, won't you, darling.

Maxine stands, puts some stuff in her purse.

CRAIG
Don't you want to know what happened
to me?

MAXINE
(considers)
No.

Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm.

CRAIG
This is important!

MAXINE
(looking at his hand on her arm)
It better be.

Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

CRAIG
There's a tiny door in that empty
office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
takes you inside John Malkovich.
You see the world through John
Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
Turnpike.

MAXINE
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
John Malkovich?

CRAIG
He's an actor. One of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

MAXINE
What's he been in?

CRAIG
Lots of things. He's very well
respected. That jewel thief movie,
for example. The point is that this
is a very odd thing, supernatural,
for lack of a better word. It raises
all sorts of philosophical questions
about the nature of self, about the
existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
right, is duality an illusion? Do
you see what a can of worms this
portal is? I don't think I can go
on living my life as I have lived
it. There's only one thing to do.
Let's get married right away.

MAXINE
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

CRAIG
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

MAXINE
Good. We'll sell tickets.

CRAIG
Tickets to Malkovich?

MAXINE
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

CRAIG
But there's something profound here,
Maxine, we can't exploit it.

MAXINE
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
to offer a partnership to you, but
this way it's more money for me.

CRAIG
You wanted to be partners with me?

MAXINE
(bored)
Sure. It'd be fun.

CRAIG
(pleased)
Really?
(then:)
But, Maxine, can of worms! End of
the world! Illusory nature of
existence!

MAXINE
I'll protect you, Dollface.

Maxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately
between her thumb and forefinger.

CRAIG
(in love)
Oh. Maxine.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Craig and Lotte are getting into evening clothes.

LOTTE
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such
thing as a portal into someone else's
brain.

CRAIG
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte.
I was right inside him looking out.
We're going to be rich.

LOTTE
I want to try.

CRAIG
What?

LOTTE
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow
morning. Plus I'd like to meet this
partner of yours.

CRAIG
(nervously)
Well, you know we're going to be
very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you
what. Let's do it tonight. Right
now.

LOTTE
Now?

CRAIG
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On
the way to Lester's house.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Craig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in.

CRAIG
I'll meet you on the turnpike.

LOTTE
I'm scared.

The door slams shut.

CRAIG
Me too, babe.

Craig hurries out the door.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Malkovich is in the shower. We watch from his POV as
he soaps himself. He does this in a sensual manner.

LOTTE (V.0.)
Holy cow!

Malkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself
dry.

LOTTE (V.0.)
Oh, yes. Yes.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

Lotte lands in the ditch. She is wet and ragged. Traffic
whizzes by. Craig turns on the headlights in his parked
car. They shine on Lotte. Craig steps out of the car.

LOTTE
I have to go back.

CRAIG
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.

LOTTE
I have to go back now.

CRAIG
We'll talk about it in the car.

Craig helps Lotte up and toward the car.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

Craig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window.

LOTTE
I have to go back, Craig. Being
inside did something to me. All of a
sudden everything made sense. I knew
who I was.

CRAIG
You weren't you. You were John
Malkovich.

LOTTE
(tickled)
I was, wasn't I?
(yelling out the window)
I was John fucking Malkovich!
(laughs, then intensely)
Take me back, Craig.

CRAIG
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

It's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras.
Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed
table with all different sorts of juices in front of them.
Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her.

LESTER
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand
a word I'm saying?

LOTTE
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.

LESTER
Oh, be still my heart.

LOTTE
Dr. Lester, would you point me
toward the restroom?

LESTER
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down
that hall, ninth door on the left.
Watch the step down. It's sunken,
you know.

Lotte smiles, and heads down the hall.

CRAIG
Dr. Lester...

LESTER
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?

CRAIG
No thank you sir. It's delicious,
though. I just wanted to thank you
for the opportunity to work at
LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm
going to have to tender my resignation
effectively immediately.

LESTER
I see. Are you unhappy at our little
company?

CRAIG
No sir, not at all. It's just that
I'm going to open my own business
and...

LESTER
And what sort of business will this
be? If you don't mind my asking.

CRAIG
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right
on 7 1/2 actually.
(beat)
In the vacant office. So we'll still
be seeing each other.

LESTER
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil.
Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz,
there are certain ""doors"" which
should never be opened.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lotte walks down the ritzy hallway. She is counting closed
doors in search of the bathroom. She opens a door, looks
inside, gasps, then enters the room.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER' S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lotte enters the room. It is dark. At the far end there
is what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich.
The centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph
of Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares
at it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Lotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in
much the same way as Malkovich. Her eyes are closed. She
opens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror.
Disappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the
bathroom.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

Craig sits at his work table. He is pulling the heads off
of the Craig and the Maxine puppets. He puts the Maxine
head on the Craig puppet. He sighs.

CRAIG
My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING

Maxine sits at her desk composing an ad. Craig stands
behind her, ostensibly looking over her shoulder, but
actually studying the back of her head. He sighs.

MAXINE
Okay. Here it is.
(reading)
Ever want to be someone else? Now you
can. No kidding. Only two hundred
dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit
J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building.
etc., etc.

CRAIG
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing.
Phone it in.

Maxine dials the phone. Lotte enters.

CRAIG
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet
shop?

LOTTE
Fuck pets. Is this your partner?
I had to come back and do the
Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything
else. Is this her?

MAXINE
(into phone)
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.
(to Lotte)
Hi, are you Craig's wife?

LOTTE
Yes, Hi.

CRAIG
Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.

Lotte and Maxine shake hands.

LOTTE
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?

MAXINE
Hi, uh.
(into phone)
Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes.
""Ever want to be someone else?""
No, that's the ad, but let's talk
about you in a minute. ""Ever want
to be someone else? Now you can.
No kidding...""

CRAIG
(to Lotte)
Why aren't you at work?

LOTTE
I've been going over and over my
experience last night. It was amazing.
(beat)
I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't
that the craziest thing?

CRAIG
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah
talking.

LOTTE
Everything felt right for the first
time. I need to go back to make sure,
then if the feeling is still there.
I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman
about sexual reassignment surgery.

CRAIG
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an
allergist. If you're going to do
something, do it right.

CRAIG (cont'd)
(beat)
It's just the thrill of seeing through
someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll
pass.

LOTTE
Don't stand in the way of my
actualization as a man, Craig.

MAXINE
(hanging up the phone)
Let her go, Craig. I mean ""him.""

CRAIG
(anything for Maxine)
Yeah, okay.
(opens the portal door)
I'll pick you up.

Lotte enters. Craig closes the door. stands there.

MAXINE
You better hurry. Traffic.

Maxine tosses Craig his car keys. He heads out the door.
Maxine dials the phone.

home phone? That's great. Love ya
and owe ya.

CUT TO:

INT. JOHN MALKOVICH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Malkovich's POV. He sits on the couch. drinks coffee,
and reads a copy of Awake and Sing. Bach plays on the
stereo in the background.

MALKOVICH
(reading aloud)
So you believe in God... you got
something for it? You worked for
all the capitalists. You harvested
the fruit from your labor? You got
God!

LOTTE (V.0.)
What raw, animal power!

MALKOVICH
But the past comforts you? The
present smiles on you, yes?

The phone rings. Malkovich puts down the script, and picks
up the phone.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Yeah?

MAXINE (0.S.)
(telephone voice)
Mr. Malkovich?

MALKOVICH
Who's calling?

MAXINE (0.S.)
You don't know me, but I'm a great
admirer of yours.

MALKOVICH
How'd you get this number?

MAXINE (0.S.)
It's just that I fantasize about
you and, well, speaking to you
now has gotten me sort of excited
and...

LOTTE (0.S.)
(turned on)
Oh, I like this.

MALKOVICH
Listen, this is not amusing. Please
don't call here any...

MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling)
Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are
at attention, General Malkovich, sir.
So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at
eight. Please, please meet me there.
I just adored you in that jewel thief
movie...

Malkovich hangs up the phone.

LOTTE (V.O.)
My God!
(attempting thought control)
Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
her there. Meet her there. Meet her
there...

Malkovich goes back to his script.

LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
her there...

Malkovich picks up a pen and writes: Bernardo's 8:00.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - MORNING

Craig waits. Lotte pops into the ditch. She's wet and slimy.

CRAIG
How was it?

LOTTE
I have to go back tonight. At eight
Exactly.

CRAIG
Why?

LOTTE
Don't crowd me, Craig.

CUT TO:

INT. BERNARDO'S - NIGHT

Malkovich's POV. It's a busy Italian restaurant. Malkovich
looks around, checks his watch: 8:03. A guy walks up to him.

GUY
Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?

MALKOVICH
Yes.

GUY
Wow. You were really great in that
movie where you played that retard.

MALKOVICH
Thank you very much.

GUY
I just wanted to tell you that. And
say thank you. I have a cousin that's
a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
means a lot to me to see retards
portrayed on the silver screen so
compassionately.

The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters
the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
out of the crowd. She looks around.

LOTTE (V.O.)
Maxine!

Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

MAXINE
Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
come. I'm Maxine.

Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
her hand.

MALKOVICH
I'm John. I didn't think I was going
to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
by your voice.

LOTTE (V.O.)
God, she's beautiful. The way she's
looking at me. At him. At us.

MAXINE
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
my voice is probably the least
intriguing thing about me.

LOTTE (V.O.)
I've never been looked at like this
by a woman.

MALKOVICH
Can I get you a drink?

MAXINE
Whatever you're having.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the
window.

CRAIG
So how was it? What was he doing?

LOTTE
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
around his apartment. I think he must
be a lonely man.

CRAIG
You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
You shouldn't be so quick to assume
that switching bodies would be the
answer to all your problems.

LOTTE
You're right. You know I was thinking
that we should have Maxine over for
dinner. Since you two are partners
and all. It might be a nice gesture.

CRAIG
I don't know. There's some tension
between us. I'd hate to expose you to
that.

LOTTE
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
We'll smoke a joint.
(dreamily)
Tensions will melt away.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating
lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an
awkward silence.

LOTTE
(to Maxine)
Did you know that Eskimos have not
one, but fifty words for snow. It's
because they have so much of it.

CRAIG
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

MAXINE
Ah.

LOTTE
After that I'll introduce you to my
favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
trauma. But we're getting to the
bottom of it.
(whispers)
Psychotherapy.

There is another silence.

MAXINE
(to no one in particular)
The way I see it, the world is divide
into those go after what they want
and those who don't. The passionate
ones, the ones who go after what they
want, may not get what they want, but
they remain vital, in touch with
themselves, and when they lie on
their deathbeds, they have few
regrets. The ones who don't go
after what they want... well, who
gives a shit about them anyway?

Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

CRAIG
You?

Lotte looks away.

MAXINE
Craig, I just don't find you
attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
with you, but only when you're in
Malkovich. When I looked into his
eyes last night, I could feel you
peering out. Behind the stubble and
the too-prominent brow and the male
pattern baldness, I sensed your
feminine longing peering out, and
it just slew me.

CRAIG
(disgusted)
My God.

Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the
table.

MAXINE
(to Lotte, removing her hand)
Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry.
(gets up)
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
(walks past kitchen. to Craig)
No hard feelings, partner.

Maxine exits. Craig and Lotte look at each other.

LOTTE
I want a divorce.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING

It is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks.
The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every
once in a while looking up and discreetly checking out
Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.

CRAIG
(a little too urgently)
Come in!

Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.

ERROLL
Hello, I'm here about the ad.

CRAIG
Please, have a seat.

Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He
glances nervously over at Maxine.

ERROLL
When you say, I can be somebody
else, what do you mean exactly?

CRAIG
Exactly that. We can put you inside
someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

ERROLL
Oh, this is just the medical
breakthrough I've been waiting for.
Are their any side effects? Please
say no! Please say no!

MAXINE
No.

ERROLL
Long term psychic or physiological
repercussions?

MAXINE
No. Don't be an ass.

ERROLL
Can I be anyone I want?

MAXINE
You can be John Malkovich.

ERROLL
Well that's perfect. My second
choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
Too good to be true! You see, I'm
a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
I've tried all the diets, my friends.
Lived for a year on nothing but
imitation mayonnaise. Did it work?
You be the judge. But Malkovich!
King of New York! Man about town!
Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!
The Schopenhauer of the 20th century!
Thin man extraordinaire!

MAXINE
Two hundred dollars, please.

ERROLL
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!

Erroll takes out his wallet.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Craig waits by his car, checks his watch. ""Pop!"" Erroll
plops into the ditch, wet and unkempt. He looks around,
sees Craig, charges him with a yell and gives him an
enormous bear hug.

ERROLL
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thousand times, thank you!

CRAIG
(gasping for air)
Tell your friends.

ERROLL
Oh, I will, and I have many,
many friends and associates, my
friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters
Anonymous. All of them fat and alone
like me, all of them dream of being
someone else, all of them with John
Malkovich as their second choice!

This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!

MAXINE
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door
behind him, locks it.

LESTER
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.
(nods to Maxine)
Ma'am

CRAIG
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
talking about.

LESTER
There are rules, boy, procedures,
etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
been waiting seventy years to utilize
this room, grooming myself, quietly
setting the stage, performing
ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all
his motion pictures again and again.
Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping
properly.

CRAIG
You're insane.

LESTER
I am not alone. There are others. We
are legion. You will pay for this
blasphemy. You will pay dearly.

Lester exits. Craig looks at Maxine. There is a moment
of tension. Finally:

MAXINE
Crackpot.

Craig opens the door. The first few fat people move noisily
into the room.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. LESTER'S ALTAT ROOM - NIGHT

Many cloaked people in the room kneeling with candles in
hand before the lit photo of Malkovich. Lotte kneels in the
back row. They chant:

DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH
How much do we love you? We loved
you in ""Making Mr. Right."" That is
how much we love you. We even own the
director's cut on laser disc. Please
accept us into your head as we have
accepted you into our hearts. Please
let us be you. Amen.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S DINING ROOM - A BIT LATER

The worshippers mill about, chatting, drinking coffee,
nibbling on cookies.

LESTER
May I have your attention, please.
We have a new disciple among us tonight.

DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH
Hallelujah.

LESTER
She is the wife of Schwartz.

A stunned hush falls over the group.

LOTTE
(apologetically)
I'm getting divorced.

LESTER
No you mustn't, my child.

LOTTE
But why, Son of Malkovich?

LESTER
We need you on the inside, my child.
To report on his comings and goings,
and if need be, to... destroy him...
(hands Lotte a gun)
...for lack of a better word.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Craig is putting stuff in boxes. Lotte enters in her cloak.

LOTTE
What are you doing?

CRAIG
I'm moving. Remember? What's with
the hooded cloak?

LOTTE
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been
thinking. Let's try to work this out.
We've got so much history.

CRAIG
(still packing)
You should feed your animals. They're
looking peaked.

LOTTE
I'm getting rid of the fucking
animals.

CRAIG
What?

LOTTE
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've
lost interest. Besides, they're
standing between you and me.

CRAIG
No they're not.

LOTTE
You've always hated the animals.

CRAIG
You've always loved the animals.

LOTTE
I'm giving them up. I've changed.
I've found a new focus.

CRAIG
What's that?

LOTTE
(beat)
Us, of course.

Craig looks up from his packing. He and Lotte stare at each
other for a long while.

CRAIG
(tenderly)
Oh, Lot...

They hug.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
What about Maxine?

LOTTE
Fuck Maxine.

CRAIG
We wish.

They look at each other and laugh, them fall back into the
embrace. They both get faraway looks in their eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

The clock reads 3:00 AM. Craig, in his pajamas, is working
the Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare
puppet stage. Craig seems possessed.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The phone rings. Maxine sleepily picks it up.

MAXINE
Yes?

LOTTE (O.S.)
I have to see you. Can you call him
and invite us over?

MAXINE
When?

LOTTE (O.S.)
Give me one hour to get inside him
Exactly.

Maxine checks her alarm clock. The time is 3:11 AM.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

Lotte drives.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - A BIT LATER

The doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown,
answers it. John Malkovich stands there.

MAXINE
Thanks so much for coming over.

MALKOVICH
Oh, I'm really glad you called.

Maxine gestures for him to enter. As Malkovich passes by
her, she checks the wall clock. The time is 3:50.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Lotte sits on the floor in the dark. She leans, out of
breath, against the wall next to the portal and checks her
watch. The time is 4:10. She pulls open the door.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Maxine and Malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other
on the couch.

MAXINE
So, do you enjoy being an actor?

MALKOVICH
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

The digital clock on the VCR clicks over to 4:11 AM.
Maxine's look softens, and she kisses Malkovich hard
on the lips. He seems surprised, but quickly warms to
it. We shift top Malkovich's POV as Maxine begins to
unbutton Malkovich's shirt.

LOTTE (V.O.)
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.

MAXINE
I love you, Lotte.

LOTTE (V.O.)
Maxine...

MALKOVICH
(stopping)
I'm sorry, did you just call me
""Lotte""?

MAXINE
Do you mind?

MALKOVICH
(thinking)
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.

They get back to it.

MAXINE
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.

MALKOVICH
(thinks he's playing along)
Yes, Maxine, yes.

LOTTE (V.O.)
This is too good to be true.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A sweaty and spent Craig sneaks back into the bedroom.
He sees that the bed is empty.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

With a gasp and a wail of release, Lotte pops into the
ditch. She is soaking wet and breathes heavily. She
just lies there.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Craig is hunched over a cup of coffee. The front door
can be heard to open. After a moment Lotte appears in
the kitchen doorway. She is caked with dirt. Craig
looks up at her.

CRAIG
You were him last night, weren't you?

LOTTE
(quietly)
Yes.

CRAIG
And he was with her.

LOTTE
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.

CRAIG
We?

LOTTE
Me and John.

CRAIG
Don't forget me.

LOTTE
Well, you have the Maxine action
figure to play with.

Craig looks down at his coffee.

LOTTE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

CRAIG
Life is confusing, isn't it?

LOTTE
Sometimes we're forced to make
hard decisions.
(beat)
I'd like for us to stay together,
Craig. You know, platonically,
if that's possible. I truly value
our friendship.

CRAIG
I feel that somehow my parents never
prepared me to make this particular
decision. Not that I blame them. How
could they know? Today's world is so
complicated.
(beat)
No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry,
Lotte. I'm so sorry.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING

Craig enters with red-rimmed eyes. Maxine sits at her
desk, actually looking kind of radiant.

MAXINE
You're late.

CRAIG
Are you torturing me on purpose?

MAXINE
(matter of fact)
I've fallen in love.

CRAIG
I don't think so. I've fallen in
love. This is what people who've
fallen in love look like.

MAXINE
You picked the unrequited variety.
Very bad for the skin.

CRAIG
You're evil, Maxine.

MAXINE
Do you have any idea what its like
to have two people look at you with
total lust and devotion through the
same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose
you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.

Craig turns and walks out the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Craig hurries past a long line of fat people, all looking
eager, all clutching cash.

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Lester sits at his desk. The intercom buzzes.

LESTER
(depressing switch)
Yes, my dear?

FLORIS (O.S.)
(intercom voice)
Someone names A Lot of Warts on
line two.

LESTER
Thank you, Floris.

FLORIS (O.S.)
(intercom voice)
Think, Jew florist?

LESTER
(pressing line 2)
Good morning, Lotte!

LOTTE (O.S.)
Dr. Lester, everything's falling
apart.

CUT TO:

INT. GUN SHOP - MORNING

Craig is at the counter buying a pistol.

CUT TO:

INT. JUICY-JUICE JUICE BAR - MORNING

Lester and Lotte sit at a table. They both have really
large glasses of carrot juice in front of them.

LOTTE
I blew it, Dr. Lester.

LESTER
You followed your heart, my child,
and that is not necessarily a bad
thing.

LOTTE
But now we've lost access to Craig.

LESTER
(laughs)
My child, I don't think its a great
mystery what Craig's up to.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Craig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear
the front door unlock. Lotte enters. She does not see
Craig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte
screams. Craig holds the gun to her head.

LOTTE
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed
to cherish me forever. Now you hold
a gun to my head?

CRAIG
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.

LOTTE
Suck my dick!

CRAIG
(slapping her)
Shut up!

Lotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead.
She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig
dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his
ear to the receiver also.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
Tell her you need to see her.

LOTTE
(to Craig)
You bastard.

Craig cocks the pistol.

MAXINE (V.O.)
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else
can be.

LOTTE
(looking at Craig)
I have to see you.

MAXINE (V.O.)
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's
business hours. I need to keep the
membranous tunnel open for paying
customers.

CRAIG
(sotto)
Tell her, what the hell, close
early today, live dangerously.

LOTTE
What the hell, darling. Close early
today, live dangerously.

MAXINE (V.O.)
Oooh, doll. I love this new
devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,
I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll
see both of you in one hour.
Exactamundo.

Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs
it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed,
and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter.

LOTTE
(screaming)
Help! He's locking me in a cage!

Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly.

NEIGHBOR
Shut up!

PARROT
Shut up!

CRAIG
Lesson number one: Be careful what
you teach your parrot.

Craig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah
watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and
holds his stomach.

CUT TO:

INT. BROADHURST THEATER - DAY

Malkovich is rehearsing some business on stage. Maxine
watches from the house. She anxiously checks her watch,
then points to it so Malkovich can see.

MALKOVICH
Tommy, can I take fifteen?

CUT TO:

INT. MALKOVICH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on the make-up table,
against the mirror.

MAXINE
Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...

We now watch the scene from Malkovich's POV.

MALKOVICH
Maxine...

CRAIG (V.O.)
I can't believe it. This is too
good to be true.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Craig is toweling himself off, hurriedly combing his
hair. Maxine enters.

CRAIG
You're glowing again.

MAXINE
A girl has a right to glow if
she wants. It's in the fucking
constitution.

Maxine sits. Craig smiles to himself.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Craig is feeding the various caged animals. He puts two
plates of food in Elijah's cage. Lotte is ungagged and
unbound now. She eats as Craig slumps down next to the
cage, gun in hand.

CRAIG
It was lovely being you being
Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen
the passionate side of sweet Maxine
before, or her actual tits for that
matter. If only, I've been thinking
to myself, if only I could actually
feel what Malkovich feels, rather
than just see what he sees... And
then, dare I say it, if only I could
control his arms, his legs, his
pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

LOTTE
It'll never happen, fuckface.

CRAIG
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,
Lambchop.

LOTTE
What's that?

CRAIG
I'm a puppeteer.

Craig picks up the phone and dials. He smiles as he
holds the receiver up to Lotte's face.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on Maxine's couch.

MAXINE
Lotte, this is so good...

CRAIG (V.O.)
(tense, commanding)
Move right hand across her left breast
now. Move right hand across her left
breast now. Move right hand across her
left breast now.

Malkovich clumsily, awkwardly moves his hand across Maxine's
breast.

CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Holy shit, yes!

MALKOVICH
Holy shit, yes!

CRAIG (V.O.)
Holy shit! He said what I said!

MALKOVICH
Holy shit! He said what I said!

MAXINE
Lotte? Is that you?

CRAIG (V.O.)
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

MALKOVICH
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
(scared)
What the fuck is going on? I'm not
talking. This is not me!

MAXINE
Oh, Lotte...

Maxine kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. There is a
sucking sound.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

There is a pop and Craig lands in the ditch.

CUT TO:

INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.

MALKOVICH
Something was making me talk. Some
Goddamn thing was making me move. I
gotta get out of here.

MAXINE
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
for me taking hold.

MALKOVICH
No, Dollface, I know what my passion
taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
contentedly.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
and gagged.

CRAIG
I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
I made him talk. And, oh, there was
the beginning of sensation in the
fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
matter of practice before Malkovich
becomes nothing more than another
puppet hanging next to my worktable.
Coffee?

CUT TO:

INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's
Cube.

MALKOVICH
It's like nothing I've ever felt
before. I think I'm going crazy.

KEVIN BACON
I'm sure you're not going crazy.

MALKOVICH
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
like nothing I've...

KEVIN BACON
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
Were you stoned?

MALKOVICH
Yes, but you see, someone else was
talking through my mouth.

KEVIN BACON
You were stoned. Case closed. End
of story. How hot is this babe?

MALKOVICH
I think it might've been this Lotte
woman talking through me. Maxine
likes to call me Lotte.

KEVIN BACON
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
to channel some dead lesbian lover.
Let me know when you're done with her.
This is my type of chick.

MALKOVICH
I'm done with her now. Tonight really
creeped me out.

KEVIN BACON
You're crazy to let go of a chick who
calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
friend.

MALKOVICH
I don't know anything about her. What
if she's some sort of witch or
something?

KEVIN BACON
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.
Ha ha ha.

MALKOVICH
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

KEVIN BACON
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against
the wall. After a moment, Maxine emerges from the building
and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
distance.

CUT TO:

INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
Maxine sees ""J.M. Inc."" stenciled on the office door. He
turns to the first fat man and line.

MALKOVICH
Excuse me, what type of service does
this company provide?

FAT MAN
You get to be John Malkovich for
fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

MALKOVICH
(quietly flipped)
I see.

FAT MAN
No cutting, by the way.

Malkovich pounds on the door.

FAT MAN (CONT'D)
No cutting!

Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
him. Craig steps out of the office.

CRAIG
Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
Everybody gets a chance to be...

The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

FAT MAN
It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
Malkovich! I hope me and my
associates from Overeaters Anonymous
didn't hurt you too terribly.

MALKOVICH
(to Craig)
Inside.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Craig and Malkovich enter. Maxine looks up, startled, but
controlling it.

MAXINE
Darling!

MALKOVICH
What the fuck is going on?

CRAIG
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
a little business her that...
simulates, for our clientele, the
experience of... being you, actually.

MALKOVICH
Simulates?

CRAIG
Sure, after a fashion.

MALKOVICH
Let me try.

CRAIG
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
comparison to the actual experience.

MALKOVICH
Let me try!

MAXINE
Let him try.

CRAIG
Of course, right this way, Mr.
Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.

MALKOVICH
(repulsed by the slime)
Jesus.

Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

CRAIG
What happens when a man climbs
through his own portal?

MAXINE
(shrugs)
How the hell would I know? I wasn't
a philosophy major.

CUT TO:

INT. MEMBRANOUS TUNNEL - DAY

Malkovich crawls through. It's murky. He's tense. Suddenly
there is a slurping sound.

CUT TO:

PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE

We see Malkovich hurtling through different environments.
It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored
lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet
clown paintings.

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's
wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is
also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the
table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.

GIRL MALKOVICH
Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich...

Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches,
pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.

WAITER MALKOVICH
Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich?

GIRL MALKOVICH
Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich.

WAITER MALKOVICH
Malkovich Malkovich.
(Turning to Malkovich)
Malkovich?

Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is ""Malkovich.""
He screams:

MALKOVICH
Malkovich!

The waiter jots it down on his pad.

WAITER MALKOVICH
Malkovich.

Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for
the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich
is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a
'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

SINGING MALKOVICH
Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich...

Malkovich flies through the back door.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
there with his van. On its side is painted ""See The World
in Malk-O-Vision"" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
huddled and shivering and soaking wet.

CRAIG
So how was it?

MALKOVICH
That... was... no... simulation.

CRAIG
I know. I'm sorry...

MALKOVICH
I have been to the dark side. I have
seen a world that no man should ever
see.

CRAIG
Really? For most people it's a rather
pleasant experience. What exactly did
you...

MALKOVICH
This portal is mine and must be sealed
up forever. For the love of God.

CRAIG
With all respect, sir, I discovered
that portal. Its my livelihood.

MALKOVICH
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
you in court!

Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.

CRAIG
(calling after him)
And who's to say I won't be seeing
what you're seeing... in court?

Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

MOTORIST
Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
and hits him on the head.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants.
He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She
looks haggard.

LOTTE
Once this was a relationship based
on love. Now you have me in a cage
with a monkey and a gun to my head.

CRAIG
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
claim to that love the first time you
stuck your dick in Maxine.

LOTTE
You fell in love with her first.

CRAIG
Yeah but I didn't do anything about
it. Out of respect for our marriage.

LOTTE
You didn't do anything about it out
of respect for the fact that she
wouldn't let you near her with a ten
foot pole, which is, by the way,
about nine feet, nine inches off
the mark anyway.

CRAIG
(beat)
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
have I become? My wife in a cage
with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
Betrayal in my heart.

LOTTE
Maybe this is what you've always
been, Craig, you just never faced
it before.

CRAIG
Perhaps you're right. I can't let
you go though. Too much has happened.
You're my ace in the hole.

LOTTE
I need a shower.

CRAIG
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
some kind of monster. I'm the guy
you read about in the paper and go,
""he's some kind of monster.""

LOTTE
You're not a monster, Craig. Just
a confused man.

CRAIG
I love you so much.

She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.

CRAIG (CONT'D)
But I gotta go now. I've got to go
be Johnny.

MAXINE (O.S.)
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

LOTTE
We have to meet.

MAXINE
One hour.

Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.

CRAIG
I'll tell you all about it when I
get home.

Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands
Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly
watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow.
Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into
his eyes.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads ""Africa.""
The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
them up. The safari men laugh.

SAFARI MAN
Well, there monkeys ain't going
nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
brews 'fore the boss comes back...

The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
Son, untie your mother and me!
Quickly! Before the great bald
chimp-men return.

A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
speaks.

CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
Hurry, Elijah!

SAFARI MAN
Why you little bastard!

Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the
ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He
works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her
mouth.

LOTTE
Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
the cage, and dials the phone.

LOTTE
Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me
in John the last three times. Craig's
had me locked up in the apartment. He
made me call you at gunpoint. It's
been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

MAXINE (O.S.)
(beat, calmly)
Really? Well, you know, he's quite
good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
a session with Malkovich I have to
attend. I'll speak with you soon.

LOTTE
But Maxine, I thought it was me you
loved.

MAXINE (O.S.)
I thought so too, doll. I guess we
were mistaken.

Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

LOTTE
Hello, Dr. Lester?

CUT TO:

INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands
there, dressed in an evening gown.

MALKOVICH
Come on in.

MAXINE
I can explain about the portal,
darling.

MALKOVICH
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
just let you up here to tell you
that, and to tell you that I'm taking
you and Schwartz to court.

MAXINE
Oh shut up.
(beat)
Craig, darling are you in there?

Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
against him will.

MALKOVICH
Yes. How did you know it was me?

MAXINE
Lotte called me.

MALKOVICH
Oh, so the bitch escaped.

MAXINE
Apparently you can control this
Malkovich fellow now.

MALKOVICH
I'm getting better all the time.

MAXINE
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
kitchen table, then make him eat an
omelette off of it.

MALKOVICH
(as Malkovich)
No... damn... you...
(as Craig)
Oh shut up, you overrated sack of
shit.

Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind
while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig)
laughs wildly.

Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi
desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and
hollow-eyed.

LESTER
You know I think it pays to leave
juice-making to the trained
professionals. You look terrible,
my dear.

LOTTE
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
Lester.

LESTER
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
inform you that I find that highly
arousing.

LOTTE
No, you don't understand. I've been
inside Malkovich when I'm with
Maxine...

LESTER
(slaps Lotte furiously)
What?! That is not allowed. My God,
you are supposed to be one of us.
You know you must never partake of
Malkovich by yourself!

LOTTE
No, I didn't know that.

LESTER
Oh, didn't anyone show you the
indoctrination video?

LOTTE
No.

LESTER
Oh, sorry. Right this way.

CUT TO:

INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

Lotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium.
The projector whirs. The screen lights up.

TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

LESTER ON FILM
Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
As you may already know, today a
baby was born into this sad world.

We see a shot of a newborn.

LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
His name is John Horatio Hannibal
Malkovich. And we are the keepers
of the door to his soul. One day,
when his brain is big enough, we
will all journey into his head and
live there for all eternity. Following
the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
we will build the ultimate communist
community, one body and hundreds,
maybe thousands, of brains inside
working together to form a super
human intellect capable of curing
disease, stopping all war, and
ruling the world with a benevolent
fist. We will take a wife, a woman
of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
is, as yet, still an infant herself.

We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
her hair.

LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
DeMent.

LOTTE
Does Floris know that she's the
chosen?

LESTER
Well, I tried to explain it to her,
but...

Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

CUT TO:

INT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
relaxed.

MAXINE
You still there, sweets?

MALKOVICH
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
it's all in the wrists.

MAXINE
Wow.
(little girl pout)
Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

MALKOVICH
You mean with Malkovich?

MAXINE
I'd love to see your work.

MALKOVICH
(pleased)
Really? Yeah. Okay.

Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
I'll do something I call ""Craig's
Dance of Despair and Disillusionment.""

Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

MAXINE
(moved)
That was incredible. You're brilliant!

MALKOVICH
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
with dolls.

MAXINE
You're right, my darling, it's
so much more. It's playing with
people!

Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

MAXINE
Stay in him forever?

MALKOVICH
(as Malkovich, screaming)
No!
(as Craig, calmly)
But how will we make a living,
my love, if our clientele doesn't
have access to our product?

MAXINE
Well, we'll have all the money in
Malkovich's bank account, plus he
still gets acting work occasionally.

MALKOVICH
(as Malkovich, breaking through)
No! Please!
(as Craig, to Malkovich)
Shut up, will you? We're trying to
think here.
(to Maxine)
It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
I like that about it.

MAXINE
No one would ever have to know its
not him.

MALKOVICH
(an idea)
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
What if we presented Malkovich as the
world's most complicated puppet and
me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
with the Great Mantini!

MAXINE
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT

The worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.

LOTTE
I have sinned, unwittingly, against
the community. And for this I am
truly sorry.

MAN #2
W-w-what's it like on the inside?

LOTTE
Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

MAN #2
Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
it's time.

LESTER
Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
all prepared, and perhaps this
Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
a bit. We will enter the portal
tonight!

Everyone cheers.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

MALKOVICH
(Craig to Malkovich)
Shut up!
(to Maxine)
Sorry, dear, I lost control for
a minute.

MAXINE
(kissing him)
It's okay, my sweet.

They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

LESTER
Aaaahhhh, the portal!

LOTTE
(to Malkovich)
You bastard!

Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds
her back.

LESTER
No! Don't harm the vessel!

LOTTE
It's Craig in there, I can tell.

LESTER
I understand, but we must protect
the vessel at all costs.
(to Malkovich)
Please, Craig, please step aside
and allow us to have what is
rightfully ours.

CRAIG
Squatter's rights, Lester.

Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
triumphantly over at Lotte.

MAXINE
Now excuse us, we have an
entertainment legend to create.

LESTER
(to the cult members)
Clear the way for them, my friends.
They will be dealt with in due time.

The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
exit.

LESTER (CONT'D)
Now, let's see what we can do to
salvage this portal... for the sake
of all that is good.

The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
skin on the rough gray surface.

CUT TO:

INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

A slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.

AGENT
Of course, send him right in. Don't
ever keep him waiting again. Do you
understand?

Malkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out
his hand.

AGENT (CONT'D)
John! Great to see you! Sorry about
the cunt at reception.

MALKOVICH
This is my fiancee Maxine.

The agent shakes Maxine's hand.

AGENT
Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about
the cunt at reception. Please have a
seat.

Malkovich and Maxine sit.

AGENT (CONT'D)
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

MAXINE
No thanks.

AGENT
(into phone)
Teresa, get me a chicken soup.
(to Malkovich and Maxine)
Chicken soup?

Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads ""no.""

MALKOVICH
I'll get right to the point, Larry.
I'm a puppet now...

AGENT
Okay.

MALKOVICH
I'm being controlled by the world's
greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...

AGENT
(no clue)
Oh yeah, he's good.

MALKOVICH
... and I want to show off his skills
by performing a one-puppet
extravaganza in Reno.

MAXINE
Vegas.

MALKOVICH
Vegas. Can you arrange that?

AGENT
Sure, sure. Just let me make a
couple of calls.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

The cult members are still there, now with picks
shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is
excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2
emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.

MAN #2
That's the last of it, boss.

Lester peers through the door.

LESTER
Well, let's see what we've got
here.

Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind
him.

CUT TO:

INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS

Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a
flash of light.

CUT TO:

INT. BUNKER - DAY

The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
views the scene through somebody's POV.

LESTER (V.O.)
My God, where am I? This seems so
familiar.

The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

LESTER (V.O.)
My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

DIRECTOR
Cut!

We look over to see a director and camera crew.

LESTER (V.O.)
Oh, I'm just the actor in that
Twilight Zone episode.

There is a popping sound.

CUT TO:

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
shakes his head ""no.""

CUT TO:

INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

LESTER
Thank you all for your efforts,
but I'm afraid we can no longer get
into Malkovich through the portal.

LOTTE
(panicky)
Why not? I need to get in there!

LESTER
I'm not certain, my dear, but I
believe your husband has somehow
psychically diverted the route.

LOTTE
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
of him in the name of the order, Son
of Malkovich.

LESTER
I'm afraid that no physical harm
must come to him as long as he
inhabits the vessel.

MAN #3
(raises hand)
Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
build another portal to Malkovich,
like around back, and sneak in that
way?

MAN #4
Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

LESTER
Actually, my friends, I suppose its
time I told you, I'm Captain James
Mertin.

The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

LESTER (CONT'D)
You see, Lester is an anagram for
Mertin.

Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
tense now.

LESTER (CONT'D)
It used to work, I'm sure of it.

Several members check their watches.

LESTER (CONT'D)
Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
from the board to face the congregation.

MAN #3
How can this be? I thought you were
only one hundred and five years old.
Mertin would have to be...

LESTER
(chuckles amiably)
I'm two hundred and five, truth be
told.

WOMAN #1
(flirtatiously)
You don't look a day over one
hundred and five, Captain. What's
your secret?

LESTER
Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
That, and a deal with the Devil.

There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

MAN #2
So what exactly are you saying? Are
we in cahoots with the Dark Master
here?

LESTER
Surprise.

The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

LESTER (CONT'D)
Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
into Malkovich, we still get to rule
the world, just like I told you. The
only difference is that we rule in the
name of evil, instead of good.

People stop in their tracks.

MAN #3
That's the only difference?

LESTER
Absolutely.

The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

LESTER (CONT'D)
So anyway...

Lotte stands.

LOTTE
Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
of you.

Lotte heads for the door.

LESTER
My dear, let me assure you that when
we attain power, it will be much more
pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
than for those outside.

Lotte stops and turns.

LOTTE
I'll take my chances.

She exits.

LESTER
Anybody else?

WOMAN #1
Do we get to wear a crown?

LESTER
But of course.

WOMAN #1
Count me in.

LESTER
Good. I think its time to beckon
Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
out of this pickle.

FLIP TO:

INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER

Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
him.

FLEMMER
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
I didn't anticipate this.

LESTER
And as I said, sir, we can't very
well exert physical persuasion upon
the sacred vessel Malkovich.

FLEMMER
Right, Lester. I heard you the first
time. I'm not a dummy.

LESTER
Didn't mean to imply that you were,
sir.

FLEMMER
Look, I'm going back to my house
to ponder this. So stay calm and
keep track of Schwartz's comings
and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
of Schwartz's wife, will you?
(to cultists)
Nice to meet you all.

The cult members ad-lib ""same here, sir.""

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

LOTTE
Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
not human. People are treacherous
and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
my heart to two of them and I almost
lost my soul to another. And I'm no
better. Look at the way I keep you,
locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
Well, I've been in a cage too, my
friends. Literally and figuratively.
So tonight I set you free.

Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
she is alone.

LOTTE (CONT'D)
Good-bye, friends.

A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still
there and holding her hand. She smiles.

LOTTE (CONT'D)
Hello, friend

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted
street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns
the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and
Lotte's building.

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

LOTTE
They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
I know too much. I should get the
door. It's impolite to keep death
waiting.

Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

CUT TO:

EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

The marquee reads: World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig
Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.

CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the
dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number,
reclines on the couch.

MAXINE
This is it, lover. You're stepping
onto that stage a nobody and
presto-change-o, you're coming
back the greatest puppeteer the
world has ever seen.

MALKOVICH
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
me hard today.

Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

MAXINE
Doesn't he know how important
tonight is to us?

MALKOVICH
He's a selfish bastard.

CUT TO:

INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
them. The lights go down.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
great privilege of the Luxor hotel
and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
and his magical puppet John
Malkovich.

The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

LESTER
Blasphemous bastard.

Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
nimble and the audience ""oohs"" and ""aahs.""

LESTER (CONT'D)
(grudgingly)
Pretty good though.

Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: ""Kiss Today
Goodbye."" in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
him.

USHER
Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
there's not an empty seat in the
entire house.

MANTINI
(not taking his eyes from the stage)
Make one empty.

USHER
Y-y-y-es sir.

The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
performing the ""back of the car scene"" from ""On The
Waterfront."" He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

LESTER
Not too shabby.

Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a
beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
juggling chainsaws.

MANTINI
Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
cultists get up.

CUT TO:

INT. SEWER - NIGHT

Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
supplies: food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
and sits down next to her.

LOTTE
They're going to take over the
world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
But, then, evil already reigns,
doesn't it? So what difference
does it make if John Malkovich
is wearing the fucking crown while
it's reigning?

Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
returning.

CUT TO:

INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.
Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls
are lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his
head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

FLEMMER
It's open.

The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

LESTER
It's just me, boss. I brought
croissants.

Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

FLEMMER
Have a seat. I wracking my brain
over this Malkovich thing.

LESTER
We saw his show at the Luxor last
night.

FLEMMER
(impressed)
Vegas? What'd you think?

LESTER
The kid's got talent. You've never
seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
had him up there singing and dancing.
Impressions.

FLEMMER
Impressions? Those are hard.

LESTER
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
we can't kill him.

FLEMMER
I suppose I could come to him in a
dream. I don't know. That's the best
I can think of right now.

LESTER
A scary dream?

FLEMMER
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
dream.

LESTER
(noncommittally)
I like that.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is
surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking
champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing
table, brushing her hair.

MALKOVICH
They love me, darling! ""Craig Schwartz
is fantastic!"" The New York Times.
""If only Craig Schwartz had always
been inside Malkovich!"" Women's Wear
Daily. ""Craig Schwartz - The world's
greatest puppeteer!"" Paul Wunder,
WBAI Radio.

MAXINE
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
We're going to ride this straight to
the top.

MALKOVICH
Sleepy suddenly.

MAXINE
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why
don't you climb into bed, and I'll
meet you there in just...

But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts
blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HELL - NIGHT

Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
grin.

CRAIG
Who are you?

FLEMMER
I am the Devil.

CRAIG
Oh.

FLEMMER
Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

CRAIG
Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.

MAXINE
Bad dream, darling?

MALKOVICH
I've got to leave Malkovich.

MAXINE
You've got to be kidding.

MALKOVICH
I just had the most horrifying
nightmare. The devil was in it.

Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
with himself.

MAXINE
Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
can't back out because of some
stupid dream.

FLEMMER
(to himself)
Shit.

MALKOVICH
Honey, we can be happy and poor
together.

MAXINE
(laughs derisively)
Perhaps you'll want to consult that
Ouija board again.

There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

MAXINE (CONT'D)
Yeah what?!

MALKOVICH
Derek Mantini!

Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
Maxine give each other the once over.

MANTINI
(still eyeing Maxine)
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

MALKOVICH
Did you see the reviews?

MANTINI
Yeah, I saw them

MALKOVICH
Because if you missed any, I just
happen to have copies here you can
take with you when you leave now.

MAXINE
I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
with Malkovich.

MANTINI
Very impressive. I could use a
producer with your vision. And
other outstanding attributes.

MALKOVICH
She's not available.

MANTINI
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

MAXINE
Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

MANTINI
I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
more importantly, mine. Here's my
proposal: There's only room in this
world for one ""World's Greatest
Puppeteer."" Correct? So let's allow
the puppet-going public to crown
their king.

MALKOVICH
How do we do that?

MANTINI
A friendly competition, if you will.
Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
Truman puppet appear opposite each
other in a play. Not some Vegas
Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
that requires actual acting. The
audience decides who is more deserving
of the title. The losing puppeteer
bows out graciously. Goes back to
obscurity as a file clerk.

MALKOVICH
What's the play?

MANTINI
Say... ""Equus""? It's got everything.

MALKOVICH
Never heard of it.

MANTINI
Broadway's finest three hours. It's
about the suppression of the
individual. Conformity as God in
modern society.

MALKOVICH
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

MANTINI
Nothing but acting to hide behind,
buddy-boy.

MALKOVICH
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
with the National Puppet Company's
production of ""Long Day's Journey
Into Night.""

MANTINI
Great then.

MALKOVICH
Is there dancing?

MANTINI
No.

MALKOVICH
Who needs dancing?

Lester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the
door. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his
shoulder.

LESTER
How'd it go? Did you say the
philodendron gets water or no?

FLEMMER
No, for God's sake, I just watered
it yesterday.
(beat)
It almost went well. I gave a pretty
good dream, but circumstances arose.

LESTER
What kind of circumstances?

FLEMMER
Maxine says she'll leave him if he
leaves Malkovich, plus he's been
challenged to a puppet-duel by
Mantini.

LESTER
The Great Mantini?

FLEMMER
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course
the Great Mantini!

LESTER
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
saw him do ""Tru"" with his sixty
foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

FLEMMER
But I think I have another plan.

LESTER
(snippy)
Do tell. I love a good plan.

FLEMMER
Why are you being like this?

Lester shrugs.

LESTER
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
the plan.

FLEMMER
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
needs it, I help Mantini's performance
a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
show.

LESTER
Can you do that? I mean, do you know
anything about puppetry?

FLEMMER
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
handle it.

LESTER
I was just asking. No disrespect
intended.

FLEMMER
Fine. Let's drop it.

LESTER
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
doubting you, it's just that I know
puppetry is a skill that takes a long
time to acquire.

FLEMMER
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

LESTER
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a
letter from Alex Trebek.

Lotte and Elijah, now dirty and drawn, are talking. Elijah
uses sign language.

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
You've got to tell Craig what's going
on. He must never leave Malkovich.

LOTTE
I'm glad you learned sign language,
Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.
I'm tired of this conversation. I'm
tired period. What has the world ever
done for me that I should feel
personally responsible for saving it?

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
It is better to light one candle than
curse the darkness. I learned that
from you.

Lotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face.

LOTTE
What have I become?

The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood
planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and
stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.
Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the
flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman
and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
Do you dream often?

MALKOVICH
Do you?

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
It's my job to ask the questions.
Yours to answer them.

wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as
a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the
actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine.

MAXINE
(without turning around)
Keep your eyes in your pants, old
timer.

CUT TO:

INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER

It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves
through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation.
Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple:

THEATERGOER #1
That Truman puppet is downright
boring as the psychiatrist.

THEATERGOER #2
It's a wooden performance, really.
Get it? Wooden?

Second couple:

THEATERGOER #3
What's with the Malkovich puppet?
He was much better in Vegas when he
played the piano with his feet.

THEATERGOER #4
I hate it when they try to stretch.
It's like Woody Allen.

Third couple:

THEATERGOER #5
They both stink! I'm going across the
street to second act Miss Saigon.

CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror.
Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights
up a cigarette.

MAXINE
You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,
lover, cause right now you're running
neck and neck with the dead president.
And you're both in last place.

Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his
head.

CUT TO:

INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles
Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.

CHARLES NELSON REILLY
You're doing beautifully, my boy. I
wept at the speech about your wife.

Flemmer materializes behind Mantini

CHARLES NELSON REILLY
What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break
for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in
mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,
too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls
for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his
pocket.

CUT TO:

INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT

We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace
as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to
be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his
movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's
as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
I can hear the creature's voice. It's
calling me out of the black cave of
the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
torch, and there he stands -- waiting
for me. He raises his matted head. He
opens his great, square teeth and says
(mocking)
'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
imagine you can account for Me?
Totally, infallibly, inevitably
account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'

Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this
bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and
sees a silent, rapt crowd.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER

Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.
During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to
upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising
his ten foot eyebrows in surprise...

MALKOVICH
Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!
Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!
... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the
street. She is dirty but determined.

CUT TO:

INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL

Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
it. Truman speaks.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
In. Out .. In ... Out ...

Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

AUDIENCE MEMBER
(to his wife)
That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
actor.

FLEMMER
(blood boiling)
Bastard is stealing my thunder.

Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
talks.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
delivered from madness. What then?
He'll feel himself acceptable! What
then?

Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
erase the welts cut into his body by
flying manes.

The audience ""ooohs"" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from ""Swan
Lake."" The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
will be quite safe. You'll save your
pennies every week, till you can
change that scooter into a car...

The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings ""Mr.
Bojangles"", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
raised from the dead.

ACTUAL TRUMAN
Where am I? Aren't I dead?
(possessed)
Vote for Mantini!

Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

CUT TO:

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.
Thunderous applause is heard in the background.

MALKOVICH
Good-bye, Maxine.

MAXINE
Whatever.

Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.

MALKOVICH
(weak but relieved)
I'm back! My nightmare is over.

CUT TO:

INT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a
walkie-talkie.

FLEMMER
(into walkie-talkie)
Okay, now!

CUT TO:

INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds
the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and
the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,
while shrieking a war cry.

CUT TO:

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
cry and runs out onto the stage.

CUT TO:

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the
audience.

MALKOVICH
(now sounding like fifty voices)
I am your earthly king! Kneel before
me!

The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
their knees.

CROWD
(like automatons)
Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath
figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the
theater.

CUT TO:

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for
the exit.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT

A dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and
cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually
merges with the landscape.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

CHYRON: LATER THAT WEEK

Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
everything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets,
the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
street looks up.

MALKOVICH
(fifty voices)
Greetings, my lowly subjects.

FLORIS
Great things, my lonely subtext?

MALKOVICH
(rolls his eyes)
Boy, be careful what you wish for.
(to Floris)
Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
will you?

Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
(to the people on the street)
I am bored. You will dance for your
king now.

Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
Faster! Faster, my little trained
monkeys!

The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
help, nobody dares.

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

This place is filled with life: Colorful birds, lizards,
cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
Must you take this terrible demon
on yourself, my love?

LOTTE
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
Malkovich and destroy him from the
inside. If not me, who?

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
If there was any way I could go in
your place. But I'm only a monkey
and...

LOTTE
(puts finger to his lips)
Hush, sweetheart.

Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
embrace.

LOTTE
(to the animals)
I'll be with you always, my friends.
Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
rejoin you with wings and a beak.

ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
and a halo.

Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

PARROT
(softly)
Good-bye. Good-bye.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
the others, and enters the building.

CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

CUT TO:

INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

LOTTE
My God!

CRAIG
I'm so glad you're safe. You look
really wonderful.

LOTTE
I'm in love. For the first time.
It's funny, but when it happens to
you, there's no question.

CRAIG
He's a lucky man.
(beat)
Do I know him?

LOTTE
It's Elijah.

CRAIG
The iguana?

LOTTE
The monkey.

CRAIG
Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
I'm sure he's a better lover than I
ever was.

LOTTE
A better friend.

CRAIG
(beat)
I'm sorry for everything.

LOTTE
(pecking him on the cheek)
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
in an odd sort of way.

CRAIG
You came up here looking for the
portal?

LOTTE
Yeah. I was going to kill him from
the inside.

CRAIG
And yourself too in the process. God,
you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
see that before?

LOTTE
You saw it once. Now you see it again.
That's life, isn't it? And you were
up here to try the same thing, weren't
you?

CRAIG
I suppose. But they got here first,
the lousy bastards. So now it's all
over, I guess.

LOTTE
I don't know. There's a small
community of us. We have a place they
don't know about. We're happy. We'll
keep trying to figure out a way. Come
stay with us. Join the struggle.

CRAIG
You'll have me, after all I've done
to you?

LOTTE
People make mistakes.

CRAIG
I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
I just want you to know that.

LOTTE
I know.

CRAIG
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
help things grow, to encourage life.
Do you and your friends need a farmer?

LOTTE
Sure. We could really use a farmer.
We'd be grateful for the help.
(beat)
Also, I think, you know, if you
wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
puppet show every once in a while,
would do a lot to lift our spirits.
You know, if you wouldn't mind too
terribly.

Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

LOTTE (CONT'D)
Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
elevator.

CRAIG
I love you, Lotte.

We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

MANTINI
(in Craig's voice)
I can't wait to see where you and your
friends live, Lotte.

LOTTE (O.S.)
It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

FLEMMER
One serpent, coming up.

Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
tunnel.

MUSIC IN: ""Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head"" by They
Might Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.

Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay

Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"", they kept demanding
And he really came

They put some poison into his wine

There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity

My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby!
[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
[Outro: Lil Nas X]

So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me

And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious

Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
You're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiend's how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
I thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you

I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team

I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye

And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

Still remains within the sound of silence

Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

Ten thousand pеople, maybe more

People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence

[Chorus]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silenceEmbed"

By the sinewy forequarters of the mare Pocahontas and by the white shoulders of Finnuala you should have seen how that smart sallowlass just hopped a nanny’s gambit out of bunk like old mother Mesopotomac and in eight and eight sixtyfour she was off, door, knightlamp with her, billy’s largelimbs prodgering after to queen’s lead.

The old humburgh looks a thing incomplete so. It is so. On its dead. But it will pawn up a fine head of porter when it is finished. In the quicktime. The castle arkwright put in a chequered staircase certainly. It has only one square step, to be steady, yet notwith-stumbling are they stalemating backgammoner supstairs by skips and trestles tiltop double corner. Whist while and game.

What scenic artist! It is ideal residence for realtar. By hims ingang tilt tinkt a tunning bell that Limen Mr, that Boggey Godde, be airwaked. Lingling, lingling. Be their maggies in all. Chump, do your ephort. Shop! Please shop! Shop ado please! O ado please shop! How hominous his house, haunt it? Yesses indead it be! Nogen, of imperial measure, is begraved beneadher. Here are his naggins poured, his alladim lamps. Around the bloombiered, booty with the bedst. For them whom he have fordone make we newly thankful!

Tell me something. The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise, Mr, Porter (Bar-tholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, a poopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. Porto da Brozzo! Isn’t that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I stone us I’m hable. To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in the wood are they for? Why, for little Porter babes, to be saved! The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is one. thing you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The Corsicos? They are numerable. Guest them. Major bed, minor bickhive. Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for ex-ample? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness. She is dadad’s lottiest daughterpearl and brooder’s cissiest auntybride. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace it would ask of Grecian language, of her goodness, that legend golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! Here’s newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and helio-trope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out of Boccuccia’s Enameron. Would one but to do apart a lilybit her virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had instantt with her handmade as to graps the myth inmid the air. Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not for ghost sake! Itis dormition! She may think, what though little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what two dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat’s asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bim-bushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what? I mean, our strifestirrer, does she do fleurty winkies with herself Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. O, she talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel bary-tinette she will gift but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. So do I, much. Dulce delicatissima! Doth Dolly weeps she is hastings. Will Dally bumpsetty it is tubtime. Allaliefest, she who pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blue to scarlad till her temple’s veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more pro-misefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy Susy Maucepan of Merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. Platsch! A plikaplak.

And since we are talking amnessly of brukasloop crazedledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle. Whene’er I see those smiles in eyes ’tis Father Quinn again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will take his dane’s pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some-where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.

Hush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post-humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger!He will be quite within the pale when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir Blake tribes bleak while through life’s unblest he rodes backs of bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint-ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha’scint for my sweet an anemone’s letter with a gold of my bridest hair betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing-lad in the Hoy’s Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, weals in a sniffbox. Som’s wholed, all’s parted. Weeping shouldst not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nyche! Be ones as wes for gives for gives now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, soft adieu, for these nice presents, kerryjevin. Still tosorrow!

Jeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are commanding from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome vinesregent’s lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally hand-some chief sacristary’s residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen’s seats. Here are heavysuppers — ’tis for daddies housings for hun-dredaires of our super thin thousand. By gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! ’Tis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the presence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talkingtree and sinningstone stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be gar-nered up with sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, Archfieldchaplain of Saint Lucan’s. How familiar it is to see all these interesting advenements with one snaked’s eyes! Is all? Yet not. Hear one’s. At the bodom fundus of this royal park, which, with tvigate shyasian gardeenen, is open to the public till night at late, so well the sissastrides so will the pederestians, do not fail to point to yourself a depression called Holl Hollow. It is often quite guttergloomering in our duol and gives wankyrious thoughts to the head but the banders of the pentapolitan poleetsfurcers bassoons into it on windy woodensdays their wellbooming wolvertones. Ulvos! Ulvos!

Whervolk dorst ttou begin to tremble by our moving pictures at this moment when I am to place my hand of our true friend-shapes upon thee knee to mark well what I say? Throu shayest who? In Amsterdam there lived a . . . But how? You are trem-blotting, you retchad, like a verry jerry! Niet? Will you a gui — neeser? Gaij beutel of staub? To feel, you? Yes, how it trembles, the timid!

Putshameyu! I have heard her voice some-where else’s before me in these ears still that now are for mine.

Sonly all in your imagination, dim. Poor little brittle magic nation, dim of mind! Shoe to me now, dear! Shoom of me! While elvery stream winds seling on for to keep this barrel of bounty rolling and the nightmail afarfrom morning nears.

When you’re coaching through Lucalised, on the sulphur spa to visit, it’s safer to hit than miss it, stop at his inn! The hammers are telling the cobbles, the pickts are hacking the saxums, it’s snugger to burrow abed than ballet on broadway. Tuck in your blank! For it’s race pound race the hosties rear all roads to ruin and layers by lifetimes laid down riches from poormen. Cried unions to chip, saltpetre to strew, gallpitch to drink, stonebread to break but it’s bully to gulp good blueberry pudding. Doze in your warmth! While the elves in the moonbeams, feeling why, will keep my lilygem gently gleaming.

In the sleepingchambers. The court to go into half morning. The four seneschals with their palfrey to be there now, all balaaming in their sellaboutes and sharping up their penisills. The boufeither Soakersoon at holdup tent sticker. The swabsister Katya to have duntalking and to keep shakenin dowan her drogh-edars. Those twelve chief barons to stand by duedesmally with their folded arums and put down all excursions and false alarums and after that to go back now to their runameat farums and re-compile their magnum chartarums with the width of the road between them and all harrums. The maidbrides all, in favours gay, to strew sleety cinders on their falling hair and for wouldbe joybells to ring sadly ringless hands. The dame dowager to stay kneeled how she is, as first mutherer with cord in coil. The two princes of the tower royal, daulphin and deevlin, to lie how they are without to see. The dame dowager’s duffgerent to present wappon, blade drawn to the full and about wheel without to be seen of them. The infant Isabella from her coign to do obeisance toward the duffgerent, as first futherer with drawn brand. Then the court to come in to full morning. Herein see ye fail not!

It is for a true glover’s greetings and many burgesses by us, greats and grosses, uses to pink it in this way at tet-at-tet.

The procurator Interrogarius Mealterum presends us this pro-poser.

Honuphrius is a concupiscent exservicemajor who makes dis-honest propositions to all. He is considered to have committed, invoking droit d’oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere-mias, two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, For-tissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under volun — tary chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to ur;, e Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware’s) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandes-tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler blend, D’Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara, Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday’s view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren-dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen-ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter! affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for camal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding), to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?

This, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D’Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay-ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com — mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun-dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em-bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors’ disagree-ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar — nishee attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could lo — cate the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class, with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger’s Cottages, the Doyle’s country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy-lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth’s first of all in ex-change at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the crŠme-de-citron, vair ‚mail paon-coque or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to en — dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and this having been handed up for the bench to look at in camera, Coppinger’s doll, as she was called, (annias, Mack Erse’s Dar, the adopted child) then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satis-faction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Break-fast and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated, he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler, who, reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the find-ings of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treuson, fending the dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, occupante extremum scabie, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity (the Calif of Man v the Eaudelusk Company) when, how and where mamy’s mancipium act did not apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse, (Hal Kilbride v Una Bellina) Pepigi’s pact was pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem would whistle for the rhino. Will you, won’t you, pango with Pepigi? Not for Nancy, how dare you do! And whew whewwhew whew.

Only trees such as these such were those, waving there, the barketree, the o’briertree, the rowantree, the o’corneltree, the behanshrub near windy arbour, the magill o’dendron more. Trem! All the trees in the wood they trembold, humbild, when they heard the stop-press from domday’s erewold.

Tiss! Two pretty mistletots ribboned to a tree, up rose libe-rator and, fancy, they were free! Four witty missywives, wink — ing under hoods, made lasses like lads love maypoleriding and dotted our green with tricksome couples, fiftyfifty, their chil-tren’s hundred. So childish pence took care of parents’ pounds and many made money the way in the world where rushroads to riches crossed slums of lice and, the cause of it all, he forged himself ahead like a blazing urbanorb, brewing treble to drown grief, giving and taking mayom and tuam, playing milliards with his three golden balls, making party capital out of landed self-interest, light on a slavey but weighty on the bourse, our hugest commercial emporialist, with his sons booing home from afar and his daughters bridling up at his side. Finner!

How did he bank it up, swank it up, the whaler in the punt, a guinea by a groat, his index on the balance and such wealth into the bargain, with the boguey which he snatched in the baggage coach ahead? Going forth on the prowl, master jackill, under night and creeping back, dog to hide, over morning. Humbly to fall and cheaply to rise, exposition of failures. Through Duffy’s blunders and MacKenna’s insurance for upper ten and lower five the band played on. As one generation tells another. Ofter the fall. First for a change of a seven days license he wandered out of his farmer’s health and so lost his early parishlife. Then (’twas in fenland) occidentally of a sudden, six junelooking flamefaces straggled wild out of their turns through his parsonfired wicket, showing all shapes of striplings in sleepless tights. Promptly whomafter in undated times, very properly a dozen generations anterior to themselves, a main chanced to burst and misflooded his fortunes, wrothing foulplay over his fives’ court and his fine poultryyard wherein were spared a just two of a feather in wading room only. Next, upon due reflotation, up started four hurrigan gales to smithereen his plateglass house-walls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and cross-bugled him. Later on in the same evening two hussites ab — sconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels, to pay himself off in kind remembrances. Till, ultimatehim, fell the crowning barleystraw, when an explosium of his distilleries deafadumped all his dry goods to his most favoured sinflute and dropped him, what remains of a heptark, leareyed and letterish, weeping worrybound on his bankrump.

Pepep. Pay bearer, sure and sorry, at foot of ohoho honest policist. On never again, by Phoenis, swore on him Lloyd’s, not for beaten wheat, not after Sir Joe Meade’s father, thanks! They know him, the covenanter, by rote at least, for a chameleon at last, in his true falseheaven colours from ultraviolent to subred tissues. That’s his last tryon to march through the grand tryomphal arch. His reignbolt’s shot. Never again! How you do that like, Mista Chimepiece? You got nice yum plemyums. Pray-paid my promishles!

Agreed, Wu Welsher, he was chogfulled to beacsate on earn as in hiving, of foxold conningnesses but who, hey honey, for all values of his latters, integer integerrimost, was the formast of the firm?

Oh, but I know they all know I would lose it if you would call

[Chorus]
My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah
One mile high in Nevada
She baila lambada

[Verse 2]
Eyes on you, ninth of Junе
In the heat of our summer
In thе sand on Corfu
And your T-shirt said ""Lover""
Rum and lime, body high
We'd be moving like Jagger
And we swore on our lives
It'd be like this forever

Lack-lust shown, doubt runs around pub
Routine day, repeat and mock plot
Barflies flock then stopped the sock-hop
Dance to the rhythm of a similar drum
Some never will admit a better feeling we sung
Numb to the point of popcorn rock is hip
Burn CD’s! Download, cop and quit
Loose lips let loose on ego trips
Skill decreased heavy when emo hit
No plan for the future leadership
Follow hollow dreams. Model this steelo kit
Stop-go pace, no destination... Go
Speed-race chase that mental patient. Stop
Who erased living life copas(t)etic...

We opposed but let it
Happen anyway. A penny weighs a tongue
Plus an act with a knack for beef...
But to the enemy, never the friend of me
Handing understanding I can manage
Manning time like “we demand this.”
Recess dropped, now they want business
Kids turn tricks like Kris on Christmas
Crime and little fishes

Standstill neutrals push the boat

Why weak minded try to find a choir and wanna preach like teacher
Script down sit down facts and made up
Seizure as a leisure all your sheep could take up
In the lobby of physician’s forced a needle in the fetal
Fed a blend of distress
Dis-trust then goes frontline followed
By divide at relation woes
Early bird here gets hurt first
Fake bait shock at no worm
Hate this tasteless situation?
Replace nature fake of innovation?
Great shouldn’t be remaining in waiting in aim of taking blame
No seraph’s fault with assaulted involvement in every stake claimed
Case of break, rape of address
Vacate cranium, man do the rest
Found best kept property of government suddenly
Now youth owes rent, tenant of stress
Not much more than horribly presented
Sent a notice for removal of the truth
Said was anticipated a basic assimilation
Mental ground’s been plowed
It ain’t ever gonna be done
Back on words like worth of current currency
Cools slack the noose and refute proof of urgency
Rid it now, get it out
Know urges, where they come from
Understand why hurry
Purge the lurking wicked fitted
Dimwits missed by missions of a liquid frigid
Stellar wiz kids pay insipid interest
When it mimics pictures flipped in gist and indicates
A quick dismiss of drastic on conspire list
The term is prison sift

An unbridled riff of a song, “Girls Got Rhythm” is given ballsy swagger by an unhinged yet committed vocal from the helium-voiced Scott, propelled excitedly by the Youngs’ riffing and Williams’ eighth-notes. Two songs in and you can hear the difference that Lange has made: light virtually glints off of the shiny surface of this performance, so tactile is the mid-range, so compactly-made and energetically focused is the performance. An aspect of earlier records that Lange seems to have vetoed is the recording of the room’s atmosphere, studio details such as amp feedback, fingers on live strings, studio count-ins. In doing so he might’ve lost a bit of the band’s immediacy, but he compensated for it with an air-tight but punchy—and radio-ready—album sound. I can never think of “Girls Got Rhythm” without pairing it with the opening track, and when the album was released the two were usually played back-to-back on DC101 where I lived, and on hundreds of FM stations around the country. A perpetual motion machine, “Girls Got Rhythm” was made equally for boom-boxes at the public pool and for pounding systems in the back of cars transporting happily juiced-up guys downtown for a Friday night out.

Lyrically, Scott was mining his favorite source of inspiration. I thought that I knew who these girls with the backseat rhythm were, the ones who looked through me at school, the ones who after three o’clock would shed their regulation plaid skirt, white blouse, and saddle shoes to paint-on their makeup, feather their Sun-In hair and, defying the laws of physics, stuff a hairbrush down the ass pocket of their skin-tight Calvin Kleins to hang out and smoke at the park in Kemp Mill shopping center or the ice skating rink at Wheaton Regional, flirting with guys who were already shaving. Or: those prohibited girls at E. Brook Lee, the public school located over the hill feet away from St. Andrews, but culturally a continent-sized distance. When Scott sings about the girl moving like sin and then letting him in, the colloquialisms worked well enough for us boys, giddily tense as we were with the twin pulls of piety and up-skirt peeking. “It’s like liquid love,” Bon squeals, barely suppressing the grin that knows just how outrageous the line is.

The band is fantastically loud and tight by the end of the song, Malcolm the foreman steering the sassy, smirking riff as Williams and Rudd provide the solid chassis. Rock & roll rhythm! the guys shout seconds from the song’s end, and it’s that moment that I loved when I first heard the tune; these girls don’t just hang out in the back seat, they’re silhouettes for everything that rock & roll promises.

To young guys, at least. Bon Scott’s lyrics catalogue an epic sweep through the triumvirate of men’s needs: pussy; rock & roll; drink. There’s little room in his oeuvre for fealty, or subtlety, or sensitivity to the nuances of the male-female relationship dynamic, or for extended reflection on the tension between desire and conscience, surrender and smarts. There shouldn’t be. He knows what he wants, we know what he wants, she knows what he wants. The music makes it irresistibly so.

But that doesn’t mean that, Catholic-trained, I didn’t raise an eyebrow at some of Scott’s lyrics, even when as a hopeless teenager the language I spoke was equal parts English and Hormone. When Highway to Hell appeared in the summer of 1979 I had sex on the brain. The previous summer, the Rolling Stones had released Some Girls, and “Miss You” was in heavy-rotation on D.C.-area radio stations. Laying out at Wheaton Pool in the radiant, suburban sunshine, off of school for a few months, heady with the thump of “Miss You”’s filthy beat and the surrounding tableau of girls moist with Coppertone, the enduring, insistent tradition of rock & roll and sex was working its lasting way through me, and I was happily helpless in its grip. (That my 16-year old sister was among those innocently posing against the backdrop only complicated the pleasures.)  Buzzing in the air the next few summers was the rumor that Joan Jett had gone to Wheaton High School a few years earlier and she comes to the pool sometimes! (She had indeed gone to Wheaton High. I looked eagerly for her bad reputation to strut onto the pool deck area in those years, but she never materialized.)  There was sex in the breezes and the shimmering girl-curves and though I hardly had much of it figured out or even named, the throb of “Miss You” (and of Exile’s “Kiss You All Over” and Nick Gilder’s “Hot Child in the City” and Foreigner’s “Hot Blooded”) pulsed in my chest as a girl walked by me on her way to the snack stand and I rubbed my eyes and rising through the eyespots and glare was the mythic, long-off promise of sex.

Bon Scott was writing out of a tradition that we might charitably call the Penthouse School of Realism, but he was also writing within the time-tested conventions of Dirty Blues (no doubt with autobiographical inspiration—witness “Whole Lotta Rosie,” “She’s Got Balls,” “The Jack,” “Go Down,” et al). He’s hardly the first or the last musician to mine the blues for lyrical tropes as well as for chord changes, but his knowing humor and knack for memorable turns-of-phrase made him one of the best rock & roll lyricists of his era. “People began singing about sex as soon as they began singing,” writes rock & roll historian Jim Marshall. “Dirty ballads, lewd couplets, poems, limericks, rhymes, drinking songs, all ripe with sex, have always been an important if shunned part of western culture, from the first broadside balladeers to the most current heavy metal acts.”  He adds, “Blues in general is a lyrically limited form—broads, booze and sex have a virtual stranglehold on the primitive blues singers’ mind, give or take a cameo appearance by the devil himself…and filthy blues records make up a large portion of the recorded body of work. Since that immortal day when Blind Lemon Jefferson beheld his pecker and decided it had the same leathery quality as a black snake, getting the biggest hit record of his career out of it—“Black Snake Moan” (which he recorded several times)—sex on blues discs sold.”

What Marshall calls “the golden age of the double entendre and the crude metaphor” never ended, of course. From obscure 1950s R&B singers to Seventies hard rock to daring New Wave through last month’s R&B and Hip Hop: popular music has always made room for gutter thought, memorably expressed. A sliver of history’s badly behaved: Barrel House Annie’s “If It Don’t Fit (Don’t Force It);” Lil Johnson’s “Sam—The Hot Dog Man;” Art Fowler and his Ukulele’s “No Wonder She’s A Blushing Bride;” Louise Bogan’s infamous “Shave ‘Em Dry;” Bo Diddley’s “Greatest Lover in the World;” the Sonics’ “Dirty Old Man;” the Vandals’ really racy mid-Sixties ode to a one-night stand “I Saw Her In a Mustang;” Grand Funk Railroad’s paen to groupies, “We’re An American Band,” Naughty by Nature’s catchy, acronymic “O.P.P.”  Etcetera, etcetera. Guilty even were the tidy Everly Brothers, whose “Wake Up Little Susie,” duly sanitized for Eisenhower’s America, nails the morning-after fears of a teenage couple waking up where they shouldn’t be. Common to these and other grinding songs are reliance on witty metaphors and an understanding that the listener’s in on the (dirty) joke. When Wynonie Harris sings “Keep on churning until the butter comes” or Bon howls about being “up to my neck in you,” you don’t have to have a second pair of eyes in the back of your head to see in two directions at once.

“There were always ways in which popular singers could be suggestive of sexual desire by subtle emphasis or inference,” blues historian Paul Oliver says. In the fall of 1979, as Highway to Hell was laying the foundation for its assault on the charts, the Knack were selling millions of copies of  “My Sharona,” and later “Good Girls Don’t,” teaching suburban kids everywhere burdened with teeenage madness and in-between sadness the Top 40 code for oral sex. She really got the rhythm.8Embed"

And I’m not the type to believe in signs no not at all
But oh god there’s so much love in me was written in black marker on the wall
And it made me feel different

[verse 2]
I wanna walk down streets without losers screaming at me but it’s been 20 odd years now I know that’s a pipe dream
I want you to want more of me than to just see me naked I don’t want you to have to force it or fake it
I also want you out your clothes but wanna know if I’m down I can talk to you on the phone but it’s been a year now I know that’s just a pipe dream

[Chorus]
And I wrote you this song drunk on the floor of a toilet stall
And my head is spinning there’s someone knocking on the door
And I’m not the type to believe in signs no not at all
But oh god there’s so much love in me was written in black marker on the wall
